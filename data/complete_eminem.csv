The Ringer,Kamikaze,2018,"Yeah, (Illa)
Yo, I'm just gonna write down my first thoughts
see where this takes me
'cause I feel like I wanna punch the world
in the fuckin' face right now, yeah!
Let me explain just how to make greatness
Straight out the gate, I'm 'bout to break it down
Ain't no mistakes allowed, but make no mistake, I'm 'bout
To rape the alphabet, I may raise some brows
If I press the issue just to get the anger out (brr)
Full magazine could take Staples out
Savage but ain't thinkin' 'bout no bank account
But bitch, I'm off the chain like Kala Brown
Motherfucker, shut the fuck up when I'm talkin', lil' bitch
I'm sorry, wait, what's your talent? Oh, critiquin'
My talent? Oh, bitch, I don't know who the fuck y'all are
To give a sub-par bar or even have an opinion or view
You mention me, millions of views
attention in news
I mention you, lose-lose for me, win-win for you
Billions of views, your ten cents are two
Skim through the music to give shit reviews
To get clicks, but bitch, you just lit the fuse
Don't get misconstrued, business as us'
Shit-list renewed, so get shit to do
Or get dissed 'cause I just don't get
What the fuck half the shit is that you're listenin' to
Do you have any idea how much I hate this choppy flow
Everyone copies though? Probably no
Get this fuckin' audio out my Audi yo, adiós
I can see why people like Lil Yachty
but not me though
Not even dissin', it just ain't for me
All I am simply is just an MC
Maybe ""Stan"" just isn't your cup of tea (get it)
Maybe your cup's full of syrup and lean
Maybe I need to stir up shit, preferably
Shake the world up if it were up to me
Paul wants me to chill, y'all want me to ill
I should eat a pill, probably I will
Old me killed the new me, watch him bleed to death
I breathe on the mirror, I don't see my breath
Possibly I'm dead, I must be possessed
Like an evil spell, I'm E-V-I-L (evil, spelled)
Jam a Crest Whitestrip in the tip of my dick
With an ice pick, stick it in a vise grip
Hang it on a spike fence, bang it with a pipe wrench
While I take my ballsack and flick it like a light switch
Like vice-president Mike Pence
Back up on my shit in a sidekick
as I lay it on a spike strip
These are things that I'd rather do
than hear you on a mic
Since nine tenths of your rhyme is about ice and
Jesus Christ, man, how many times is
Someone gonna fuck on my bitch? (Fuck my side chick!)
You won't ever see Em icy
But as cold as I get on the M-I-C
I polarize shit, so the Thames might freeze
And your skull might split
like I passed you upside it
Bitch, I got the club on smash like a nightstick (yeah)
Turn down for what?
I ain't loud enough, nah, turn the Valium up!
'Cause I don't know how I'm gonna get your mouths to shut
Now when it doesn't matter what caliber
I spit at, I'll bet a hundred thousand bucks
You'll turn around and just be like, ""Man, how the fuck
Sourpuss gonna get mad just 'cause his album sucks?
And now he wants to take it out on us. "" (oouu)
But last week, an ex-fan mailed me a copy
Of The Mathers LP to tell me to study
It'll help me get back to myself and she'll love me
I mailed the bitch back and said if I did that
I'd just be like everyone else in the fucking industry
Especially an effing Recovery clone of me (NFing)
So finger-bang, chicken wang, MGK, Igg' Azae'
Lil Pump, Lil Xan imitate Lil Wayne
I should aim at everybody in the game, pick a name
I'm fed up with bein' humble
And rumor is I'm hungry, I'm sure you heard bumblings
I heard you wanna rumble like an empty stomach
I heard your mumblin', but it's jumbled in mumbo-jumbo
The era that I'm from will pummel you, that's what it's comin' to
What the fuck you're gonna do when you run into it?
I'm gonna crumble you and I'll take a number two
And dump on you, if you ain't Joyner
If you ain't Kendrick or Cole or Sean then you're a goner
I'm 'bout to bring it to anyone in this bitch who want it
I guess when you walk into BK you expect a Whopper
You can order a Quarter Pounder when you go to McDonald's
But if you're lookin' to get a porterhouse
you better go get Revival
But y'all are actin' like I tried
to serve you up a slider
Maybe the vocals shoulda been auto-tuned
And you woulda bought it
But sayin' I no longer got it
'Cause you missed a line and never caught it
'Cause it went over your head
because you're too stupid to get it
'Cause you're mentally retarded
but pretend to be the smartest
With your expertise and knowledge
but you'll never be an artist
And I'm harder on myself than you could ever be regardless
What I'll never be is flawless, all I'll ever be is honest
Even when I'm gone they're gonna say I brought it
Even when I hit my forties like a fuckin' alcoholic
With a bottle full of malt liquor
But I couldn't bottle this shit any longer
The fact that I know that I'ma hit my bottom
If I don't pull myself from the jaws of defeat and rise to my feet
I don't see why y'all even started with me
I get in beefs, my enemies die
I don't cease fire 'til at least all are deceased
I'm eastside, never be caught slippin'
Now you see why I don't sleep, not even a wink, I don't blink
I don't doze off, I don't even nod to the beats
I don't even close my fuckin' eyes when I sneeze
""Aw, man! That BET cypher was weak, it was garbage
The Thing ain't even orange—oh my God, that's a reach! ""
Shout to all my colorblind people
Each and everyone of y'all, if you call a fire engine green
Aquamarine, or you think water is pink
""Dawg, that's a date. "" ""Looks like an olive to me. ""
""Look, there's an apple! "" ""No, it's not, it's a peach! ""
So finger-bang, Pootie Tang
Burger Kang, Gucci Gang, dookie, dang
Charlamagne gonna hate anyway, doesn't matter what I say
Give me Donkey of the Day
What a way for 2018 to get underway
But I'm gonna say everything that I wanna say
Welcome to the slaughterhouse, bitch! (yeah)
Invite 'em in like a One A Day
I'm not done (preach)
'Cause I feel like the beast of burden
That line in the sand, was it even worth it?
'Cause the way I see people turning's
Makin' it seem worthless, it's startin' to defeat the purpose
I'm watchin' my fan base shrink to thirds
And I was just tryin' to do the right thing, but word
Has the court of public opinion reached a verdict
Or still yet to be determined?
'Cause I'm determined to be me, critique the worship
But if I could go back, I'd at least reword it
And say I empathize with the people this evil serpent
Sold the dream to that he's deserted
But I think it's workin'
These verses are makin' him a wee bit nervous
And he's too scurred to answer me with words
'Cause he knows that he will lyrically get murdered
But I know at least he's heard it
'Cause Agent Orange just sent the Secret Service
To meet in person to see
if I really think of hurtin' him
Or ask if I'm linked to terrorists
I said, ""Only when it comes to ink and lyricists""
But my beef is more media journalists
(Hold up, hold up, hold up…)
I said my beef is more meaty, a journalist
Can get a mouthful of flesh
And yes, I mean eating a penis
'Cause they been pannin' my album to death
So I been givin' the media fingers
Don't wanna turn this to a counselling sesh
But they been puttin' me through the wringer
So I ain't ironin' shit out with the press
But I just took this beat to the cleaners"
Fall,Kamikaze,2018,"You know, everybody's been tellin' me
what they think about me for the last few months
It's too loud
Maybe it's time I tell 'em what I think about them
Can't hear it coming down the hallway stairs
from the parking lot
It's too loud
Freeze my crown all up in it
Slow fire
Don't fall on my face
Don't fall on my faith, oh
Don't fall on my fate
Don't fall on my faith, oh
Don't fall on my fate
Don't fall on my
Gotta concentrate, against the clock I race
Got no time to waste, I'm already late
I got a marathoner's pace
Went from addict to a workaholic
Word to Dr. Dre, In that first marijuana tape
guess I got a chronic case (yeah)
And I ain't just blowin' smoke
'less it's in your momma's face
I know this time Paul and Dre
They won't tell me what not to say (nope)
And though me and my party days
Have all pretty much parted ways
You'd swear to God I forgot
I'm the guy that made ""Not Afraid""
One last time for Charlamagne
If my response is late, it's just how long it takes
To hit my fuckin' radar, I'm so far away
These rappers are like Hunger Games
One minute, they're mockin' Jay
Next minute, they get their style from Migos
or they copy Drake
Maybe I just don't know when to turn around and walk away
But all the hate, I call it ""Walk on Water"" gate
I've had as much as I can tolerate
I'm sick and tired of waitin', I done lost my patience
I can take all of you motherfuckers on at once
You wanted Shady? You got him!
Don't fall on my face (yeah)
Don't fall on my faith, oh
Don't fall on my fate (line 'em up!)
Don't fall on my faith, oh (rr!)
Don't fall on my fate (look)
Somebody tell Budden before I snap
he better fasten it
Or have his body bag get zipped
The closest thing he's had to hits is smackin' bitches
And don't make me have to give it back to Akademiks
Say this shit is trash again, I'll have you twisted
Like you had it when u thought you had me slippin' at the telly
Even when I'm gettin' brain
you'll never catch me with a thot
Lackin' with it, ""he ain't spittin' like this on his last shit""
Ho, you better go back and listen
You know me better, thinkin' I'll slow or let up
Call it trap 'cause it's a total setup
Hopin' that you rappers fall in that
Dre said, ""Hold your head up! ""
Kathy Griffin stackin' ammunition
slap the clip and cock it back on competition
This is how I shot ahead (pew)
Gabby Giffords, my attack is vicious
Jack the Ripper, back in business
Tyler create nothin'
I see why you called yourself a f****t, bitch
It's not just 'cause you lack attention
It's because you worship D12's balls
you're sack-riligious
If you're gonna critique me, you better
at least be as good or better
Get Earl the Hooded Sweater
Whatever his name is to help you put together some words
more than just two letters
The fans waited for this moment
like that feature when I stole the show
sorry if I took forever (haha)
Don't fall on my face (yeah)
Don't fall on my faith, oh (I won't)
Don't fall on my fate (line 'em up!)
Don't fall on my faith, oh (ha)
Don't fall on my fate (it's too easy)
Just remember-I was here before you
And I'll be here after you make your run-in for you
Detractors, I might have to fuck Pitchfork with a corkscrew
Just what the doctor ordered
Revenge is the best medicine
Increase the dose, from least to most
Then tell the Grammys to go and fuck themselves
they suck the blood from all the biggest artists
like some leeches
So they nominate 'em, get 'em there
get a name to MC the show
Every parasite needs a host
Then give Album of the Year
to somebody that no one's ever even heard of
All I know is I wrote every single word
of everything I ever murdered
Time to separate the sheep from goats
And I got no faith in your writers, I don't believe in ghosts
When rap needed it most, I was that wing in the prayer
A beacon of hope, the B-I-R-D in the air
Somewhere, some kid is bumping this
while he lip-syncs in the mirror
That's who I'm doin' it for, the rest I don't really even care
But you would think
I'm carryin' a Oxford dictionary in my pocket
How I'm buryin' these artists
On a scale of 'turnt' you're 'minus'
Mine says 'very', yours says 'hardly'
And what's scary is you probably
Can compare me to your car
'cause I'm just barely gettin' started
And far as Lord Jamar, you better leave me the hell alone
Or I'll show you an Elvis clone
Walk up in this house you own, thrust my pelvic bone
You should telephone and go fetch me the remote
Put my feet up and just make myself at home
I belong here, clown, don't tell me 'bout the culture
I inspired the Hopsins, the Logics, the Coles, the
Seans, the K-Dots, the 5'9""s, and oh
Brought the world 50 Cent, you did squat, piss and moan
But I'm not gonna fall… bitch!
It's too loud
Can't hear it coming down the hallway stairs
from the parking lot
It's too loud
Threes not a crowd all up in it
Slow fire"
Kamikaze,Kamikaze,2018,"Okay, how do I say this? (Fack, fack, fack)
Last year didn't work out so well for me
(fack, fack, fack) (fack last year)
2018, well (fack, fack)
Yeah, I'm a fuckin' kamikaze
crashin' into everything
You beat me, Islamic Nazi
that means there is no such thing
I've been goin' for your jugular since Craig G ""Duck Alert""
Wedgie in my underwear
the whole bed sheet and the comforter
Stuck up in my rectal crack
kiss my disrespectful ass
I'll ride through your cul-de-sac
Window cracked, bumpin' your reference tracks
You collaborative effort rap
I have never said his raps
Overstayed my welcome, stepped in crap
And ruined your welcome mat
So spit that shit from the heart
you didn't write like you wrote it
While I teabag the microphone
'cause I go nuts on it
Like a fighter jet lined with explosives
that'll strike any moment
Headed right at opponents
and I'm the fuckin' pilot that flown it
I'm 'bout to—
Smash into everyone, crash into everything
Back and I've just begun, ""FACK"" 2017
Fack, fack on everyone
Fack, fack on everyone
Fack, fack on everyone
I'm a Kamikaze, gonna
Smash into everyone, crash like an F-15
Damage already done, y'all shoulda let me be
Fack, fack on everyone
Fack, fack on everyone
Fack, fack on everyone
I'm a Kamikaze, gonna
I turned to rap 'cause it made me feel tough
when I wasn't (wasn't)
From the moment I heard rap was cussin'
I was in (was in)
Which is why I identify with the guy
Who I was invented by, Dre's Frankenstein
Energized like a nine volt, ice cold
Like Snake Eyes
twice in a row on a dice roll
But if the only reason I blowed
is 'cause I'm white though
Why don't every other white rapper sell what I sold? (ooh)
Kamikaze pilot, I wrote my suicide note
Here come the guys in white coats tryin' to stop me
'Fore I jump behind the controls and try to fly into foes
'Cause I'm takin' y'all with me when I go cyclone
I don't think this typhoon's lettin' up any time soon, here I go
Eyes closed, blindfolded, I'm 'bout to—
Smash into everyone, crash into everything
Back and I've just begun, ""FACK"" 2017
Fack, fack on everyone
Fack, fack on everyone
Fack, fack on everyone
I'm a Kamikaze, gonna
Smash into everyone, crash like an F-15
Damage already done, y'all should've let me be
Fack, fack on everyone
Fack, fack on everyone
Fack, fack on everyone
I'm a Kamikaze, gonna
Smash
Kamikaze, kamikaze
Kamikaze, kamikaze, kami-kamikaze
Take a look at what I've done
I heard your freestyle on Shade 45
that shit was embarrassing
There is no way we ever air that shit again, I guarantee
That way that shit was so ass
it's somethin' we wouldn't dare re-air
The shit's embarrassing as me rear-ending Tara Reid bare
In my therapy chair, my dick is the hair length of Cher
Each nut is the chair width of an acorn
stairlift beware of me
Lyrically I'm terrible, better get your lyrics prepared
Richard Ramirez is here, serial killin' every beat there is
Wait, wait, got the eeriest feelin'
Somethin' evil is lurkin', I'm no conspiracy theorist
But somethin' here is afoot—oh yeah, it's my dick
Get the measurin' stick (what?) , twelve inches of wood
Wait, but I've been goin' for your jugular
since Craig G ""Duck Alert""
And I've come to pay respects
'Cause if you sleep you're fucked—other words
You get laid to rest
And I hope your butt is hurt
Put me on a track, I go cray on it like a color book
You got some views, but you're still below me
Mine are higher
so when you compare our views, you get overlooked
And I don't say the hook unless I wrote the hook
And now I'm just freestylin' in the vocal booth
And you know I've always spoke the truth
You lyin' through your teeth so much you broke a tooth
And it ain't somethin' I need a phone to do
When I say I can't wait 'til I get ahold of you
And I don't know what I'm s'posed to do
Line up the rappers
Take my pic like a photo shoot"
Greatest,Kamikaze,2018,"Motherfuckers talkin' crazy (yeah) , sayin' I should quit (yeah)
I fuckin' tell them make me (bitch) , eat a fuckin' dick (yeah)
I'm feelin' like the greatest (woo) , wanna be whoever did it
Mike Will the one who made it, it's Shady on the lyrics
I'm somewhat outlandish they say
You say we're cut from the same cloth
But I guess you fabricate, eh?
You better bring more men than the Latter Day Saints
Manic states, even padded with automatic stay pray
Gat anything that may stay in their way
As I stand at the bay window with a hand grenade
And a tre eight, at the Mandalay Bay
Common sense, I'm a dollar short and a day late
James Holmes at the Saturday Batman matinee
Must have missed my cat-scan that day
I just threw a Tampax at Dre
Trashcan tasks cam and ashtray
I'm turning back to a madman, can't take
Anymore but I try to get away from the anger and rage
My basic alias is an A to the K
Get your ass spayed like bidets breakin' your legs
Ain't givin' ways ankle the ways you chumps don't
Even know how to do somethin'
To give goosebumps a day when you say
That somethin' you won't give someonea lump in their throat
If you had them choked up you'd be yankin' my chain
Feelin' like I'm headed for a padded cell, the
Bar for me what I rap isn't fair but
Guess that's the standard I'm held to
But if somethin' like that doesn't tell ya
You set a mark too high
when platinum sales are looked at as a failure
then you better take it back to the shelter
And Hamburger Helper, 'cause damn it I'm still the—
Greatest in the world, greatest in the world
greatest in the world
(No lie) I might be
The best to ever do it, the best to ever do it
the best to ever do it
I feel like the greatest joker to honkies sounding like me
Never be as good, never be as good
Packing up wife-beaters, white t-shirts, but what?
I'm the greatest
So you sold 10 million albums, eh? (What?)
Only problem is, you put out 10 million albums, eh? (Haha)
Wait, what was I just about to say?
Oh yeah, let me get this out the way
I know there's people that are pissed
about the way I misprounouced a name
""DIE ANTWOORD! ""
Fuck! I still can't say the shit
But how quickly they forget who the fuck I was
Now Ninja try to duck my slugs
to let ya girl get fucked by Muggs
I'd like to give a shout to Cypress
This can't be real, you dissed me
and I was just tryin' to give you a shout
Now get the fuck out my rhyme book
No more shiners, already too much time tokin' rappers
I hear you talkin' shit, I'm just too big to respond to it
God forbid I forget, go and jump out the window
somebody better child-proof it
'Cause if I lose it we can rewind to some old Ja Rule shit
And I can remind motherfuckers I'll do shit
You don't got the tools, I got my toolkit, I bullshit you not
Ya'll fools just forgot that I'm so fuckin' awful
with the thoughts
And when I'm hostile and impossible to stop
So you call it a nostril 'cause it's not-gonna-ever
I'll never let up on the pedal might as well get the mop
'Cause I'm wiping everyone up in this genre
'Cause on the mic I feel like I'm the
Greatest in the world, greatest in the world
greatest in the world
(No lie) I might be
The best to ever do it, the best to ever do it
the best to ever do it
I feel like the greatest joker to honkies sounding like me
Never be as good, never be as good
Packing up wife-beaters, white t-shirts, but what?
I'm the greatest
Oh yeah and one more thing I want to mention
Is you're one dimension
I'm a monkey wrench and I can flunk detention
I love contentions so welcome to the gun convention
Muscles flexin', gotta strut like I flunked suspension
And you just stuck the key up in the ignition
And gave me enough gas to flood my engine (yeah)
Psychopath, Michael's Jack's blowin' up like a raft
I just slapped ISIS with a ISIS flag
bet you I come back twice as bad (uh)
Revival didn't go viral!
Denaun and Royce tell me that I should take the high road
Fuck that I'm finna hit back 'til I run out of gun powder
and split the scene
Hold the mic like similar to pistol squeeze
And I shoot from the hip when I grip them things
And my lips and the clips got the cig lit
like it's nicotine drinking, when slim gets mean
Bars on these boys when I split them schemes
That's why I call the motherfuckers M-16's
Float like a butterfly
I'ma sting like a bee you ain't harming a thing
I get a day hard as I'm gonna swing
I'm gonna need to put my arm in a sling
But like a wedding band you gotta be diamond
to even climb in the ring
An anomaly, I'm Muhammad Ali
'cause I know one day I'm gonna be the
Greatest in the world, greatest in the world
greatest in the world
(No lie) I might be
The best to ever do it, the best to ever do it
the best to ever do it
I feel like the greatest, woke up to honkies sounding like me
Never be as good, never be as good
Packing up wife-beaters, white t-shirts, but what?
I'm the greatest"
Nice Guy ,Kamikaze,2018,"You're such a nice guy, a nice guy
You're faithful, you don't lie
After the club, you go back home, right?
R-I-I-IGHT? S-I-I-IKE!
Suck my dick, you fuckin' suck, man
Suck my dick, you fuckin' suck, man
I hope that your heart get hit by a semi-truck
Suck my dick, you fuckin' suck, man
I hop in your whip and take a sip, then I gun it
I don't, I don't got much self-control, I hope that you runnin'
I'm bipolar with the switch up just as quick like you cummin'
I don't, I don't got much self-control, I hope that you runnin'
I'm not a cheater
but if I'ma be accused, might as well be
You tell me you'll take me back
when hell freezes
but females be Rushin' me outside my telly
temptation overwhelms me
Like my monthly bill from Sprint
they chargin' me for a selfie
Chargin' me, so I gave my hotel key
Eh, I was tryna be nice
You're such a nice guy, a nice guy
You're faithful, you don't lie
After the club, you go back home, right?
R-I-I-IGHT? S-I-I-IKE!
Suck my dick, you fuckin' suck, bitch
Suck my dick, you fuckin' suck, man
I hope that your heart get hit by a semi-truck
Suck my dick, you fuckin' suck, bitch
I play your music while you suffer
like I'm Carmine Coppola
You're tied up in the basement
while I chill on your sofa
La próxima yo sé que mejor me quedo sola
Estás de buenas que yo ya vendí mi pistola
I'm an emotional wreck, weak (uh-huh)
Everything over-affects me (yeah)
When you joke, it upsets me (yeah)
You say I'm no good at sex
And you think I'm gross and unsexy (uh-huh)
I need Scope 'cause my breath stinks (yep)
You hope I choke on a Pepsi (yep)
Bitch, you was supposed to correct me! (oh)
Been textin' you since three
I still get no fucking reply
You say you sleep alone
but yet your mattress is king size
Fuck you goin' in those knee-high boots?
Cut it out, bitch
I doubt that you're goin' to house sit
In that outfit, and those skin-tight Levi's
Every word that comes out your mouth's a fucking lie
Oh, it's spring time
time for you to have a fling like a slingshot
You say don't come over 'cause you got pink eye
But I think I got just the thing, why
Don't I bring my fuckin' bat and just swing by?"
Stepping Stone,Kamikaze,2018,"Its 2002, everything was totally new
We were globally huge
Watching sales go through the roof
We wrote and we viewed it
Runyon Avenue soldiers included
A multitude of homies who would bounce
for no good excuse
We were so bulletproof wrote, souped
and soaked in our youth
Thought we was running shit
till we lost the sole of our shoe
The death of Doody broke us in two
We were thrown for a loop, ain't none of us know what to do
And at the time I was going through my own struggles too
So I wasn't in no condition to be coaching us through
Everyone tried to go solo, really nobody blew
I was hoping they do
So I ain't have to shoulder the group
The plan was put everyone in position
so that they knew how to stand on they own
and I don't want to open up wounds
I just noticed the oomf was gone when we go in the booth
Cause the truth is the moment that Proof died
so did the group
If I could leave this all behind
I could open up my eyes and walk in a straight line
Down to the river with you
Help me leave this all behind
I'ma wash away my sins
I'ma rinse away this dirt
I forgot to make amends
To all the friends I may have hurt
I better stop and say my grace
From that I pray that I don't fall
'Cause on the way back down I may
May end up running back into them all
I never meant to use you all as my stepping stones
It was never the same, and it's bothered me since
And the farther we drift apart the more awkward it gets
The more time goes by, the more life happens
And we gotta be men, we got responsibilities
Plus we don't say how we feel
and I feel like this is what got us in
The debacle we're in
been with you guys thick and thin
But it's almost as if sometimes we're not even friends
Which reminded me Biz, Rockstar was the shit
Y'all could've got you a hit without me on the shit
If you've put D12 on it, wish I could've did
More than try talking you into coming up off of it
I know it wasn't my fault, but part of it probably is
I think of all of the trips to BET and the rappers
I wish that we would've politicked with
Maybe y'all coulda clicked and got you some features
But that's water under the bridge
But I'm washing my sins in it
til my conscious is clear
If I could leave this all behind
I could open up my eyes and walk in a straight line
Down to the river with you
Help me leave this all behind
I'ma wash away my sins
I'ma rinse away this dirt
I forgot to make amends
To all the friends I may have hurt
I better stop and say my grace
From that I pray that I don't fall
'Cause on the way back down I may
May end up running back into them all
I never meant to use you all as my stepping stones
Bacardi in hand
Never thought the party would end
One minute you're bodyin' shit
but then your audience splits
You can already sense the climate is starting to shift
To these kids you no longer exist
Went from rainin' cats and dogs in this bitch
To tiny drops full of drips
And by the time your reign is over, you'll hardly be missed
You start thinkin' of all the artists you gift
All the carnage you left
Is this the kinda karma you get?
For turning your fuckin' back on Bizzy, Kuniva and Swift
A Freudian slip
Subconsciously, I honestly wished
I ain't feel so much guilt and y'all didn't harbor resentment
But it's hard to pretend that y'all ain't got none of this
Wish I had words
But I guess there just are none for this
Still, my point is I just can't say how sorry I am
This is not how I planned for our story to end
I love all of you, men
But I just can't be the guy
Everybody depends on for entire careers
'Cause that's not even fair
I will always be here
But that spark isn't there
And I don't know how to recapture that time and that air
I've tried hearkening back to
But I'm fighting for air
I'm barely charting myself
Feels like I'm under the sink
But it was not my intent
To treat y'all like a stepping stone
Though I ain't left no one behind
But we been down every road
Done all we possibly can
I know we kept up our hopes up
But the longer we spend livin' this lie that we live
The less is left for closure, so let's let this go
It's not goodbye to our friendship, but D12 is over
I'ma wash away my sins
I'ma rinse away this dirt
I forgot to make amends
To all the friends I may have hurt
I better stop and say my grace
From that I pray that I don't fall
'Cause on the way back down I may
May end up running back into them all
I never meant to use you all as my stepping stones
I never meant to make you feel like my stepping stones
I never meant to use you all for my stepping stones"
Em Calls Paul (Skit),Kamikaze,2018,"[Skit: Eminem & Gps]
Paul, yo, um
So I got your message
I wish you would answer the fuckin' phone
Um
Turn right
No, I don't plan to reply to everybody
who fuckin' says something fucked up about me
But I will say this, I was reading some comments last night about, like, what people are fuckin' saying about Revival
And uhh
Yo, this Yahoo mother fucker, whatever the fuck his name is, said I, literally said I rhymed ""rhymes"" with ""chimes""
""Sucker free, confidence high
Such a breeze when I pen rhymes""
Turn right
Like, you don't understand I'm rhyming the entire fuckin' sentence you fuckin' moron
It's my fault 'cause you're fuckin' stupid
But I swear to God this motherfucker lives in Michigan and I think I figured out his address
And I'm on my way to his fuckin' house right now
Turn left
I'll hit you back later"
Paul (Skit),Kamikaze,2018,"[Skit: Paul Rosenberg]
Hey Em, It's Paul.
Umm, I listened to the new album
Umm, are you really gonna just reply to everybody
who you don't like
what they have to say uh, about you
or the stuff you're working on?
I mean, I don't know
if that's really a great idea
its-its like, what's next? Kamikaze 2
the album where you reply to everybody
who didn't like the album that you made
replying to everybody
that didn't like the previous album
It's a slippery slope
I-I don't know if it's a really good idea
Uh, anyway, hit me back"
Good Guy ,Kamikaze,2018,"Here we go again
From heroes to villains
Used to be your Romeo
But we both were jilted
A couple of times
So we had a slippery slope to deal with
But still it gave me hope
That we'll get through it together
A severed earlobe
Mailed to you in an E-N-V-E lope
Would be dope, but
What kind of lengths can you go?
Pull a Vincent Van Gogh
Just to convince a damn ho
To be a housewife who outright lies
She's blackout drunk
Now she's backin' out my drive
I ran outside, why's she tryna act out?
She's just about my size
Hit me in the mouth twice
Guys, when someone you die for
sticks a steak knife in your heart
Do you try more?
Another late night in
She stumbles through my door
Lets the daylight in
And all we do's fight more
And I ain't violent
But she's goin' through my drawers
To plant the K-Y in
I'm gettin' accused by a whore
Who smells like St. Ides and
Who has probably screwed five more guys
sucked eight, nine men
I'm takin' two by fours, to our eight by tens
Bitch it's you I tore, out the frame, I win
Put up a new high score, beat this game I'm in
And here's some two-ply for
When you date my friends
in order to wipe your ass
When you moved your bowels
When we renewed our vows
This the thanks I get
I'm waitin' for the date I can hear you say
""Marshall, what a skank I've been
And there's a new guy, you're being replaced by him""
Got your tubes tied for him
Got that boob job for him
Hurts me to my core, but the pain I'm in
After you, I swore to make the gray skies end
Here come the rays like wind
You get a pay hike and
Am I the good guy or do I just play like him
And hope that he dumps you?
It's like a dream come true
Just to scream ""Fuck you! ""
Guess you take life in the same way
you play dice then
'Cause you just look at me
and roll them little snake eyes in
Since
Since you bought the jury
They'll call me guilty
They'll call me guilty
You bought the jury
They'll call me guilty
Even though you know the real me
You can't beat a cheater
Convince a nonbeliever
And I ain't in my feelings, I'm out
But I let you say that you're the good guy
'Cause this ain't what love looks like
You can't beat a cheater
Convince a nonbeliever
I ain't in my feelings, I'm out
But I let you say that you're the good guy
They like, ""You're the good guy. ""
They like, they like, they like
""You're the good guy. """
Lucky You ,Kamikaze,2018,"Woah
Joyner, Joyner
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah
I done did a lot of things in my day
I admit it, I don't take back what I say
If I said it, then I meant it
All my life I want a Grammy
But I'll prolly never get it
I ain't never had no trophy or no motherfuckin' ribbon
Fuck the system, I'm that nigga
Bend the law, cut the rules
I'm about to risk it all
I ain't got too much to lose
Y'all been eating long enough
It's my turn to cut the food
Pass the plate
Where my drink?
This my day
Lucky you
Fuck you too, woah!
Y'all gotta move, y'all gotta move
y'all gotta move
Give me some room, give me some room, give me the juice
Hop out the coupe, hop out the coupe, how 'bout I shoot?
Y'all gotta move, y'all gotta move
give me the juice
Back on my bullshit, my back to the wall
Turn my back on you all and you're finished
Back to these bullets, it's back to the job
Put my MAC on and all of you runnin'
Back on my hood shit, it's back to the pushing
These packs and I'm actually pumpin'
Can't fuck what you rapping, you practically suckin'
You might've went platinum, but that don't mean nothin'
I'm actually buzzin' this time
Straight out the kitchen, I told them the oven is mine
I do not fuck with you guys
If I don't care you just know that you gonna suffer this time
I ain't no gangster but I got some banging
Some chains and some blades in, and a couple of knives
Choppers and jammies, a partridge in a pear tree
My twelve days of Christmas was nothing but lies
Why don't you holla like a sumo (sumo)
They say I talk like a chulo
I live in Mars, I'm not Bruno
Bitch, I'm a dog call me Cujo
You play your cards, I reverse on you all
And I might just drop four like an Uno
Cállate boca mejor, maricón, liltle puto, and all of you culo
They've invented a level off in the ghetto to ghetto
lookin' for something that prolly can never find out
Shake irrelevant and tell 'em to beef right now
What you would nigga? You really want me tied down
I've been alone, I never needed nobody
Just only me and my shotty
I'll tell these niggas to lie down
Keep all of the money I never wanted the lifestyle
I just pray to God that my son be alright now
I said ain't no love for the other side
or anyone who ever want smoke
When I die I'm going out as the underdog
who never lost hope
You in the wrong cab down the wrong path
Nigga wrong way, wrong road
Snakes in the grass, tryna slither fast
I just bought a fuckin' lawn mower
I have said a lotta things in my day
I admit it, this is payback in a way
I regret it that I did it
I done won a couple Grammys but I sold my soul to get 'em
Wasn't in it for the trophies, just the fuckin' recognition
Fuck's the difference?
I'm that cracker!
Bend the law
Fuck the rules
Man I used to risk it all
Now I got too much to lose
I been eating long enough
Man my stomach should be full
I just ate, lick the plate, my buffet
Lucky me
Fuck you think? (woo!)
I got a couple of mansions, still I don't have any manners
You got a couple of ghost writers
but to these kids it don't actually matter
They're asking me ""What the fuck happened to hip-hop? ""
I said ""I don't have any answers""
'Cause I took an L when I dropped my last album
it hurt me like hell but I'm back on these rappers
And actually coming from humble beginnings
I'm somewhat of uncomfortable winning
I wish I could say ""what a wonderful feeling""
We're on the upswing
like we're punching the ceiling
But nothing is stealing, like anyone has any fucking ability
To even stick to a subject, it's killing me
the inability to pin humility
Hatata batata
""Why don't we make a bunch of fuckin' songs about nothin'
And mumble"", and fuck it
I'm goin' for the jugular
Shit is a circus, you clowns that are comin' up
Don't give an ounce of a motherfuck
About the ones that were here before you to make raps
it's recap
Way back, MC's that
Recap, and tape decks
Eight DATs with the G raps and
Kane's at, we need three stacks
ASAP, and bring lap Masta Ace back
Because half of these rappers have brain damage
All the lean rappin', face tats
syruped out like tree sap
I don't hate trap, and I don't wanna seem mad but in fact
With a old-me at the same cat that would take that
Feedback and aim back, I need that
But I think it's inevitable
They all got button to press
or a lever to pull
It gives me the snap though (little bitch)
And if I paid attention I'd probably makin' it big
But you've been taking the dicks
On the fuckin' gag, hoe (get it?)
On the brink in a minute
Got me thinkin' of finishin' everything
With acetaminophen then reapin' the benefits
I'ma sleep at the wheel again
As I peak into thinking about an evil intent
Of another beat 'em and kill again
'Cause even if I gotta end up eating a pill again
Even ketamine or methamphetamine
With the Manidon, it better be at least 70 to 300mg
And I might as well 'cause I'ma end up being a villain again
Levels to this shit I got an elevator
You could never say to me I'm not a fuckin' record breaker
I sound like a broken record every time I break a record
Nobody could ever take away the legacy, I made a navigator
Motherfucker never got a right to be this way
I got spite inside my DNA
But I work 'til the wheels fall off, I'm workin' tirelessly, aye
It's the moment y'all been waiting for
Like California wishin' rain'd pour
And that drought y'all have been praying for
My downfall from the 8 Mile to the Southpaw
Still the same Marshall that outlaw
That they say is a writer might've fell off
But back on that bull like the cowboys
So y'all gotta move (yeah)
y'all gotta move (yeah)
y'all gotta move
Give me some room, give me some room, give me the juice
Hop out the coupe, hop out the coupe, how 'bout I shoot?
Y'all gotta move, y'all gotta move
give me the juice"

We are not alike, there's not alike us on the mic (yeah!)
I don't do Jordans and Audemars
I do explosions and Molotovs
Y'all blowing smoke as if y'all ain't washed
I blow the smoke from the car exhaust
Flying to a party I am not invited to
feeling like the streets need me (woah)
I ain't gotta dance as long as my Ferrari Spyder move
like C Breezy
I don't gotta hire goons
I'd rather try to buy the moon, and breathe freely
The sky is blue, the tie is new, the Masarati
white and cool like G-Eazy
While these dudes tryna figure out
how to do a freestyle as fly as me
I'm confused trying to figure out
how to do Capri styles and Mya G
Everybody doing chick joints
probably rob these little dudes at fist point
Remember everybody used to bite Nickel
now everybody doing Bitcoin
We don't got nothing in common (no)
We don't got nothing in common (no)
Y'all in the stuff
like doubled-up Styrofoam cups on them
uppers-and-downers (woo!)
I'm into stuff like doubling commas
Find me a brother who's solid
To count the shit up, then bust the shit down
When the cops set us up, we can flush the shit down
We can no give a fuck, shit, a fucking colonic
Selling your cock and your butt for a follower
Possible cup, for dollars you powder sniff
Now you're slipping, call it a power trip
A product of politics
Y'all went from profit and topping the charts
To dropped in the park in a pile of shit
Knowledge is power, but powerless
if you got it and you do not acknowledge it
Y'all music sound like Dr. Seuss inspired it
Hiring strippers, prostitutes retiring
We can spit it for ya it vans
I'm fit to be king, you're cut out to fit in prince pants

Acting like you catching bodies (ayy)
And you got juice, lil youngin', you're bugging
You ain't never even been charged

bitch, you ain't plugged in nothing
Rap god spit lyrical bullets (boom)
And gats cock, your partners better tool up
This has not to do with muscular
But have guns for sure, you better pull up

Now you wanna come and fuck with me, huh?

He wants to keep up
His tough demeanor, so he does a feature
Decides to team up with Nina
But next time you don't gotta use Tech N9ne
if you wanna come at me with a sub-machine gun
And I'm talking to you
but you already know who the fuck you are, Kelly
I don't use sublims and sure as fuck don't sneak-diss
But keep commenting on my daughter Hailie
I keep on telling motherfucker, bitches, in case you forgot
Really I need jaw memories
jaw like strawberry or pineapple, apricot jelly
I respond, rarely but this time Shady
'bout to sound off like a fucking cocked semi Glock
Demi god, let me put a silencer
on this little non-threatening blond fairy
cornball taking shots at me
You're not ready, fool, break yourself like Rocksteady Crew
Obviously, I'm not getting through
We can get it poppin' like Redenbach
letting off like Remy Ma
Heavy artillery, gotta deal a harsh with a hard shell
Put a motherfucking heart in bigger than Bizarre's belly
Only time you'll ever say, I lost
You'll be talking 'bout Fetty Wap, better call Diddy
Just to try to get me off
and you better hope I don't call Trick Trick
Bitch, this shit don't fly in our city
Punk, you don't disrespect OG's, R. I. P. Prodigy
Soldier in my soul
and I told them the moment he signed me
that I'll be the most hated, dumb-hated soldier
There's no shame, it's okay to own it 'cause life is a bitch
it's a bow-legged hoe
But now days are over, I Harvey Weinstein
a bathrobe hanging over
My code name is groper, I roleplay with lotion
I fucked the whole world then I throw away the Trojan
Olay the hoes like with home-made explosives
I blow eighty holes in you
Don't make me go in, I OJ the flows and I'm insult to injury
Rolex to gold in and I'm [?] tryna throw in [?]
They both hate to choke and my hoe play the [?]
And I double-edge sworded
'cause one place I poke and I stick and I turn
and I rotating motion
Invisible with the pen, I'm at the pinnacle of sick individuals
take my dick and put the tip in
At minimal, I'm fucking these syllables
I let them lick on my genitals
I'm a fucking invisible, indefensible, despicable difficult prick
a little bit unpredictable
I spit the formiddable, that you're bitches
are fucking with the original
I can say that me and Nickel are identical
But not us, the only thing we have in common
is I'm a dick and you suck
Otherwise one has nuttin' to do with the other
None comes close to
Skunk, bug, soldier
Tongue, shrub, shoulder
One month older
Sponge, mob, colder
None, rug, hoaster
Lug, nut, coaster
Lung, jug roaster
Young Thug poster
Unplugged toaster

Normal,Kamikaze,2018,"Yo, how do I keep
(Man, I don't know what's up with these hoes, man)
Gettin' in relationships like this?
(I'm just sayin')
Maybe it says somethin' about me
(Yeah, yup)
Should I look in the mirror?
I just want you to be normal
Why can't you bitches be normal?
Always gotta be so extra
Why you always need a lecture?
My ex hates to talk, she's a texter
Even when I'm in bed layin' right next to her
Wants to get back together
Said not 'til she gets her act together
She thinks I'm bein' mean and now
She starts to scream and shout
She's about to let the demons out
She don't want to see me with other females out
I tell the bitch to beat it, take the scenic route
She retaliates by tryin' to leave the house
In an evening gown with her cleavage out
We've been down this road too many times for me to count
And all I can think is how—
I just want you to be normal
Why can't you bitches be normal?
Always gotta be so extra
Like a fuckin' terrestrial
Guess it comes with the territory
My ex girl, she just declared war
Therefore, I better prepare for it
I guess bein' weird's normal
And I don't know what's got a hold of me
Most notably I've been zonin' to Jodeci
I'm totally open, hopelessly devoted
So much so that I bet you she don't even know that she's
The first thing I think of when I wake up
And the last thing I think of 'fore I go to sleep
Psych, hope she don't notice me goin' through her purse
I know she cheats, so do I
I'm soulless, she's heartless
No wonder we're partners
Both got hundreds of charges
Domestic disputes but we've always
Swept it under the carpet
Even when 911 gets the call that
I slipped up and busted her jaw with
A Louisville Slugger 'cause alls it
Really does is make our love
For each other grow stronger
She won me over the second she tried to run me over
Told her I'd keep it a hun', we over
Kicked her out, called her back, now she's coming over
But why is she so wicked?
And how the fuck did I get so twisted
Up with someone so unlikeable and shifty
We're like nitrogen and hydrogen mixed with
Ignitable liquids, but I'm finally seeing
She's only mine for the time being
That's why I keep bringin' up that one time she
Tried to two-time me
And throw it up in her face 'til I dry heave
How could I be so naive?
Should I leave or turn this entire evening
Into a motherfucking crime scene?
Maybe I'm just too ugly to compete with him
You weren't supposed to agree, you fucking bitch!
Especially when you're the one cheated first
Now the argument immediately becomes heated
You don't want me to flip, little conceited cunt
Eat a monkey dick wrapped in a stuffed pita fajita
Slut, treat it just like a drum, beat it
Complete it, and once you've succeeded, repeat it!
I love you but I hope you fuckin' die though
In our business your friends like to pry so
You've got 'em all under cover just like moles
Hopin' they'll come back with intel
But I'm the one who's thrown into the spiral
'Cause now the roles are reversed so here I go
Thinkin' I'm sly as I scroll through your iPhone
Who the fuck's Milo?
The guy at work who drives a hi-lo
I put a tracking device on your Chrysler
And follow you while you drive home
But like a cyclone, I just got my disguise blown
You recognize me and had Milo flip me off
Right out the passenger side window
I hit a light pole, you skrt off
And then pull up at 5AM in the drive
In a stretched white limo
Stumble in the side door
and hit me in the head with Milo's demo
But like a drunk bum, what do I know?
Let's sleep on it like they did Revival
I told you you're the apple of my eye
So shut your pie hole
Just wanna be normal
Why can't you be normal? (Yeah)
I just wanna be normal
Why can't you be normal?"
Venom,Kamikaze,2018,"I got a song filled with shit for the strong willed
When the world gives you a raw deal
Set you off till you
Scream, ""piss off, screw you""
When it talks to you like you don't belong
Or tells you you're in the wrong field
When's something's in your mitochondrial
'Cause it latched on to you, like
Knock knock, let the devil in
Malevolent as I've ever been
Head is spinnin' and this medicine
Screaming, ""L-l-l-let us in""
L-l-lick like a salad bowl, Edgar Allen Poe
Bedridden, shoulda been dead a long time ago
Liquid Tylenol, gelatin
think my skeleton's meltin'
Wicked, I get all high when I think
I've smelled the scent of elephant manure
Hell, I meant Kahlúa, screw it, to hell with it
I went through hell with accelerants and blew up
My-my-myself again, Volkswagen, tailspin
Bucket matches my pale skin, medal win
Mayo and went from Hellmann's and being rail thin
Filet-o-Fish, Scribble Jam, Rap Olympics, '97 Freaknik
How can I be down? Me and Bizarre in Florida
Proof's room slept on floor of the motel then
Dr. Dre said, ""Hell yeah""
And I got his stamp like a postcard
Word to Mel-Man
And I know they're gonna hate but I don't care
I barely could wait to hit them
with the snare and the bass, square in the face
This fuckin' world better prepare to get laced
Because they're gonna taste my
Venom, adrenaline momentum
And I'm not knowin' when I'm
Ever gonna slow up and I'm
Ready to snap any moment I'm

I said knock knock, let the devil in
Shotgun p-p-pellets in the felt pen
Cocked, fuck around and catch a hot one
It-it's evident I'm not done
V-Venomous, the thoughts spun
Like a web and you just caught in 'em
Held against your will like a hubcap or mud flap
Beat strangler attack
So this ain't gonna feel like a love tap
Eat painkiller pills, fuck up the track
Like, what's her name's at the wheel? Danica Patrick
Threw the car into reverse at the Indy, a nut crashin'
Into ya, the back of it is just mangled steel
My Mustang and the Jeep Wrangler grill
With the front smashed
much as my rear fender, assassin
Slim be a combination of an actual
kamikaze and Gandhi (Gandhi)
Translation, I will probably kill us both

Ain't no telling when this choke hold
On this game will end, I'm loco
Became a symbiote, so
My fangs are in your throat, ho
You're steppin' in with my
Venom
Put the ballpoint pen 'em
Gun cock, bump stock, devil eye, buckshot
Tire thumper, a garrote, tie a couple knots
Fired up and caught fire, Juggernaut
Punk rock, bitch, it's goin' down like Yung Joc
'Cause the Doc put me on like sunblock
But I fuck not, you only get one shot
Ate shit 'til I can't taste it
Chased it with straight liquor
Then paint thinner, then drank 'til I faint
And awake with a headache
And I take anything in rectangular shape
Then I wait to face the demons I'm bonded to
'Cause they're chasin' me but I'm part of you
So escapin' me is impossible
I latch onto you like a—parasite
And I probably ruined your parents' life
And your childhood too
'Cause if I'm the music that y'all grew up on
I'm responsible for you retarded fools
I'm the super villain
Dad and Mom was losin' their marbles to
You marvel that? Eddie Brock is you

Now my community's gated
And I made it, and my neighbors say hi
(say hi)
I'm giving them pounds,
I'm upscale now
Guess it means
I'm way in the sky
But I still remember the days of,
minimal wage for
General labor,
welfare recipients is a minor
Look at how government assistance has made ya
Adversity, if at first
you don't succeed
Put your temper to more use
'cause being broke's a poor excuse
That shit only gives you more fuel
Show them why you're you
So close, God,
it's like I almost got it
But close only counts
in timebombs and horseshoes
So I uni-bomb shit (tick, tick, tick)
No remorse
Screw it, I'm lit,
and that attitude I blew up on quick
That's why they call me firecracker
I grew up on wick (wick, wick, wick) with
a short fuse
I got some important news to report to
Anyone who thought I was done,
nah, bitch, not quite
Spotlight's back on,
got my faith,
where's yours?
Do you still believe in me?
Didn't I get everything I had
to give you to make you see?
I'll never forget if you
turn your back on me
Now and walk out I will
never let you live it down
(I'll never quit)
Do you still believe in me?
Man, I know sometimes these
thoughts can be harsh and cold as ice
To me, they're just ink blots
I just fling 'em like slingshots,
and so precise
So you might want to think it over twice
When you retards can roll the dice
But beef will at least cost you your career
'Cause even my cheap shots are overpriced
But this middle finger's free as a bird
Nuke warhead-ed birth,
you just forehead on Earth
Too short for a verse, studied his formula
Learned how to incorporate a curse
Point it towards corporate America
Stick a fork in it and turn
'Cause four-letter words
are more better
Heard the world force-fed a turd to me
You're getting yours
But sometimes I overdo it
But I just get so into it
I was there consoling you
when no one knew it
When your situation showed no improvement
I was that door, you walked over to it
I'm the light at the end of tunnel
so people are always looking at me
as they're going through it
When that tunnel vision is unclear,
shit becomes too much to bear
Since ""Cleaning Out My Closet""
when I was having trouble
with the snare
I'm that unrealistic prayer answered
And I'ma get you jacked up,
like you're trying
to fix a flat (uh),
when you struggle with despair
That double fisted bear,
knuckles coupled with this
pair of nuts I'm cupping
I am your fucking switch, nothing can compare
Do you still believe in me?
Didn't I get everything
I had to give you to make you see?
I'll never forget if you
turn your back on me
Now and walk out
I will never let you live it down
(I'll never quit)
Do you still believe in me?
Started from the bottom like a snowman
Oh man, put that in your
corncob pipe and smoke that
But my battery's low
I'm gonna need a booster in my pack
I know I always got Proof
on my back
I called you Proof 'cause I knew for a fact
My ace in the hole
Homie I'm calling on you
'cause I think I'm slowly
startin' to lose faith in it, so
Give me that inkling and motivation to go
Hussein with the flow
Fake fans with the two-faced that show
Let heartbeats loot,
produce hate in my soul
Laying vocals two days in a row
True statement,
hate to go down this road
But there's only one route
to cross this bridge
So I walk in this
bitch with loose change
'Cause all my dues paid
But this booth is taking its toll
But it's never too late
to start a new beginning
That goes for you too
So what the fuck you gon' do,
use the tools you're given?
Or are you going to use
the cards you were dealt
as an excuse for you to not
do shit with them
I used to play the loser victim
'Til I saw the way Proof was driven
I found my vehicle and
I haven't ran out of gas yet
And when they stacked decks,
turn handicaps into assets
Fanny packs, hourglasses
If time was on my side,
I'd still have none to waste
Man, in my younger days,
that dream was so much fun to chase
It's like I run in place
while this shit dangled in front of my face
But how do you keep up the pace
and the hunger pains once
you've won the race?
When that pool exhaust is cooling off
'Cause you don't got nothing left to prove
at all
'Cause you done already
hit them with the coup de grâce
Still you feel the need
To go through and deal with
that Bruce Willis
That blue still, that truth still
When that wheel's loose, I won't lose will
Do you still believe?"
Untouchable,Revival,2017,"Hands up
officer don't shoot
Then pull your pants up, promise you won't loot
We may never understand each other, it's no use
We ain't ever gonna grasp what each other goes through
Black boy, black boy, we ain't gonna lie to you
Black boy, black boy, we don't like the sight of you
Pull up on the side of you
Window rolled down, 'profile'
Then we wonder why we see this side of you
Probably comin' from the dope house
We could let you slide but your tail light is blew, out
We know you're hidin' that Heidi Klum
On you another drug charge, homie
it's back inside for you
And just in case a chase might ensue
we got that tried and true
Pistol drew right at you
we'd be delighted to unload it in your back
Then walk up and lay that taser on the side of you
Fucked up, but what the fuck am I to do?
I keep tellin' myself, keep doin' like you're doin'
No matter how many lives you ruin
It's for the red, white and blue
Time to go find a new one and split his head right in two
No one's ever indicted you
Why? 'Cause you're a
White boy, white boy
you're a rockstar
(My momma talkin' to me
tryna tell me how to live)
White boy, white boy, in your cop car
(But I don't listen to her
'cause my head is like a sieve)
White boy, white boy, you're untouchable
(The world's coming to an end, I don't even care)
Nobody can tell me shit
'cause I'm a
(big rockstar)
Black boy, black boy, we don't get your culture and
We don't care what our government's done
to fuck you over, man
Don't tell us your attitude's a result of that
Balderdash, where'd you get the chip on your shoulder at?
Why you kicking that soda can?
Pull your pants up
we 'bout to roll up and
Throw your ass in the van cuffed
You don't have to know our plans
or what our intentions are
Our cards are close to our chest
you better show your hands
And put our minds more at ease
Or get shot in the thyroid
comply or die, boy
We're fightin' a crime war
here come the swine
Tryna clean up the streets from all these minorities
That's what we call 'em pigsties for
They're like eyesores to police
Talk to you like just a piece of trash
Feels like we're stuck in a time warp to me
As I kick these facts and
get these mixed reactions
As this beat backspins
it's like we're drifting back in to the sixties
having black-skin is risky
'Cause this keeps happening throughout history
African-Americans have been treated like shit
And I admit, there have been times
where it's been embarrassin' to be a
White boy, white boy
you're a rockstar
(My momma talkin' to me
tryna tell me how to live)
White boy, white boy, in your cop car
(But I don't listen to her
'cause my head is like a sieve)
White boy, white boy, you're untouchable

(big rockstar)
Seems like the average lifespan of a white man
Is more than twice than a black life span
I wonder sometimes if it has a price scanner
I feel like checking out on life
Can't escape this circumstance
I'd rather hear 'em say ""Die N-word""
than Die Antwoord
Ninja, now it's better disguised banter
But that's life
strapped 'cause we're strapped financially
And can't find answers
We're applying
but Mcdonald's
Seems to be the only franchise that'll hire
So how can we have higher standards?
As Dallas overshadows the battle for Black Lives Matter
We fight back with violence
but acts like that are
Black eyes on the movement
Which makes black lives madder
At cops and cops madder
That's why it's at a stalemate
Can't arrive at a compromise so it's Black Ops
I wonder if we hire more black cops, the crap stops
The block is our backyards, officers
not the crack spot
Call the attack dogs off of us, man
You always act all pissed off at us at a traffic stop
And bad cops fuck it up for the good cops, and man, stop
Sendin' white cops
in the black neighborhoods
Who ain't acclimated to 'em
like that's the way to do it
Who seen some fuckin' videos of rappers waving guns
And know nobody black so they act afraid of us
And that's racism
the fear that a black face gives 'em
A subconscious racist
Wait, why are there black neighborhoods?
'Cause America segregated us
designated us to an area
Separated us
Section-Eight'd us
When we tear it up's the only time attention's paid to us
And education sucks
and every day's anotherfreddie Gray for us
a levy breaks or fuzz
Why is it they treat us like dryer lint?
We just want a safe environment for our kids
But can't escape the sirens
Don't take a scientist to see
our violent nature lies in
The poverty that we face
so the crime rate's the highest
in the lowest classes
it's like a razor wire fence
And we're trapped in these racial biases
That plague our society
which makes our anxiety levels raise
Every time we see a devil's face
Lions, tigers, and bears, oh my
It's more like billy clubs and gats
And we really love it when you think we're guilty
'cause we're black
""But you kill each other, facts
You peel each other's caps, for silly stuff like hats""
Single mother strugglin' through substance abuse
While people with nothin' to lose
shoot each other for shoes
Fuck your Republican views
Pull ourselves up by our bootstraps
where the fuck are the boots?
And streets act as a narrator
don't gotta read comics
Or be that into characters
just to see that, just to be black
You better be strapped with a derringer
Or be ""capped in America""
like Steve Rogers
'Cause no one oversees these cops and
All we see is 'em beat charges
We done seen 'em beat Rodney King unconscious
and got off
So we don't need all
you crooked police officers' peace offerings
Just keep marchin', 'til we reach congress
But they're gonna say you're tryin' to take an irrational stance
If you try to slander the flag but
Somebody has to be the sacrificial lamb
So they call it a Kaepernick tantrum
If you don't stand for the national anthem
We raise it, you better praise it
Or you'll be made to feel like a traitor
we'll treat you like Rodney Dangerfield
Home of the brave is still racist 'ville
So this whole nation feels like a plantation field
In a country that claims
that its foundation was based on United States ideals
That had its Natives killed
Got you singin' this star-spangled spiel
To a piece of cloth that represents the ""Land of the Free""
that made people slaves to build"
Remind Me (Intro),Revival,2017,"Damn girl
You drive me crazy
You may be crazy too
You make me do things
I normally wouldn't do
You make me feel things
That I never felt
It gotta be the real thing
'Cause you remind me of myself"
River ,Revival,2017,"I've been a liar, been a thief
Been a lover, been a cheat
All my sins need holy water
Feel it washing over me
Oh, little one, I don't wanna admit to something
If all it's gonna cause is pain
Truth in my lies right now, are falling like the rain
So let the river run
He's coming home with his neck scratched
To catch flack
Sweat jackets and dress slacks, mismatch
On his breast jacket's a sex addict
And she just wants to exact revenge and get back
It's a chess match, she's on his back
Like a jet pack
She's kept track of all his internet chats
And guess who just happens to be moving on to the next?
Actually, just shit on my last chick
And she has what my ex lacks
'Cause she loves danger, psychopath
And you don't fuck with no man's girl, even I know that
But she's devised some plan to stab him in the back
Knife-in-hand scissor relationships hanging by a strand
So she's been on the web lately
Says maybe she'll be my Gwen Stacy, to spite her man
And I know she's using me to try to play him
I don't care, hi Susan, but I shoulda said ""Bye Susan""
After the first night, but tonight I am
I've been a liar, been a thief
Been a lover, been a cheat
All my sins need holy water
Feel it washing over me
Oh, little one, I don't wanna admit to something
If all it's gonna cause is pain
Truth in my lies right now, are falling like the rain
So let the river run
One-night stand
Turned in two-night stand
He was calling so might scram
Now we hug tight, and
He found out, now she feels deserted and used
'Cause he left, so what? He did it first to her too
Now how am I supposed to tell this girl that we're through?
It's hard to find the words, I'm aloof, nervous, ensued
And witnessed you hurt
But what you deserve is the truth
Don't take it personal, I just can't say this in person to you
So I revert to the studio like Hole in the Wall diners
Don't have to be reserved in a booth
I just feel like the person who I'm turning into's
Irreversible, I preyed on you
Like it's church at the pew
And now that I got you I don't want you
Took advantage of my thirst to pursue
Why do I do this dirt that I do?
Get on my soapbox and preach, my sermon, and speech
Detergent and bleach is burning the wound
'Cause now with her in the womb
We can't bring her in this world, shoulda knew
To use protection 'fore I bit into your forbidden fruit... fuck!
I've been a liar, been a thief
Been a lover, been a cheat
All my sins need holy water
Feel it washing over me
Oh, little one, I don't wanna admit to something
If all it's gonna cause is pain
Truth in my lies right now, are falling like the rain
So let the river run
My name's (ooh) , my name's (ooh)
Denver (ooh) , watch the river run
Call me (ooh) , call me (ooh)
River (ooh) , we'll let the river run
Always the bridesmaid, never ""The bride, hey! ""
Fuck can I say? If life was a highway
The seat was an enclave, I'd be swerving in five lanes
Speeds at a high rate, like I'm sliding on ice, maybe
That's why I made they came at you sideways
I can't keep my lies straight
Well, I made you terminate, my baby
This love triangle, left us in a wreck-tangled
What else can I say? It was fun for a while
Bet I really woulda loved your smile
Didn't really wanna abort, but fuck it
What's one more lie
To tell a unborn child?
I've been a liar, been a thief
Been a lover, been a cheat
All my sins need holy water
Feel it washing over me
Oh, little one (I'm sorry) , I don't wanna admit to something
(I fucked up) If all it's gonna cause is pain
The truth in my lies now, are falling like the rain
So let the river run"
Remind Me,Revival,2017,"I bust in, devilish grin, disgustin'
Asshole, freckled cheeks and a butt chin
Calling all party animals, get on the floor
When I pop up on some Whac-A-Mole shit
In search of a chick who stacked them so thick
And implants are so big
She can hang me up on that rack, big ol' tits
Like Anna Nicole Smith
Bodies bananas and sass to go wit'
I spot you at first glance and go, ""shit""
You wearin' those pants that don't fit
That butt won't ever give up
That's why you stick it out no matter what
'Cause you got an ass that won't quit
So, get on the horn, my saxophone
Grab hold of my instrument, get a grasp, and blow
You just laugh and go heehee
'Cause you're just as nasty so that's appropriate
That's why
I love you, 'cause you remind me of me
That's why I love you, 'cause you're like me (yeah me)
I said I love you, 'cause remind me of me
That's why I love you, 'cause you're like me, nasty (yeah, me)
You know, I'm wearin' a new shirt tonight too, yo
With me on it
I'm lookin' at your tight rear like a sightseer
Your booty is heavy duty, like diarrhea
The plan's to bring you to my house
You're drinkin' Jack and Beam
I'm thinking soon as trampolines so we should bounce
But you're out of your tube-top
If you're thinking that mi casa es su casa
Yeah, you're a cute fox
Perfect ten so back that up like a moonwalk
Girl, you're smoking like Snoop Dogg
But you must be Token if you think you're taking over my quarters
There goes the dime into the jukebox
Two shots of blue Hpnotiq and soon I'll
Turn this brouha to a barroom brawl
So hit scratch on the break like the cue ball
Turn the volume all the way up on your boombox
And excuse the locker room talk, I'm just too raw
But apparently, so are you, ma
'Cause you just kicked me in the balls and told me to screw off
And that's why
I love you, 'cause you remind me of me
That's why I love you, 'cause you're like me (yeah me)
I said I love you, 'cause you remind me of me
That's why I love you, 'cause you're like me, nasty (yeah, me)
Said can I take you home, where we can be alone
Shawty, you the shit
Girl, I ordered you to sit
I know you're probably feeling me more than you admit
Pull up a chair, sweetie, let me order you a drink
I only go to meetings court-ordered from a shrink
From the bottom to the top, floor to ceiling
You ain't run of the mill, you're one in a million
'Cause real tits are still fun
But everybody knows fake tits are still better than real ones
So come and spend the night with the guy most are terrified of
But tonight, curiosity overrides ya
Besides ya fire (I love)
Like a starter pistol
Crystal and slides huns, tonight I'm your pilot
'Cause you should be up in the sky, girl, you're so fucking fly
You belong in the mile high club
So come on baby, the night's young
Don't string me along, I'm highstrung
We might wind it up, unbound like we're trying for the Cy Young
Fuckin' 'fore we get to the house, screwin' our brains out
Like changing a lightbulb
That's why I like ya, 'cause I'm crazy just like ya
Now every time I get brain, you screw mine up
I barely can think straight, your head game is a mindfuck
So ready, set, aim, and fire
Yes babe, I'm fallin' in likeness kinda
Why I love
I love you, 'cause you remind me of me
That's why I love you, 'cause you're like me (yeah me)
I said I love you, 'cause you remind me of me
That's why I love you, 'cause you're like me, nasty (yeah, me)"
Walk On Water ,Revival,2017,"I walk on water
But I ain't no Jesus
I walk on water
But only when it freezes (fuck)
Why are expectations so high?
Is it the bar I set?
My arms, I stretch, but I can't reach
A far cry from it, or it's in my grasp, but as
Soon as I grab, squeeze
I lose my grip like the flyin' trapeze
Into the dark I plummet, now the sky's blackening
I know the mark's high, butter
flies rip apart my stomach
Knowin' that no matter what bars I come with
You're gonna harp, gripe, and
That's a hard Vicodin to swallow
so I scrap these, As pressure increases like khakis
I feel the ice cracking, because
I walk on water
But I ain't no Jesus
(It's the curse of the- it's the curse of the-)
I walk on water (shit)
But only when it freezes
It's the curse of the standard
That the first of the Mathers discs set
Always in search of the verse that I haven't spit yet
Will this step just be another misstep
To tarnish whatever the legacy
Love or respect, I've garnered?
The rhyme has to be perfect, the delivery flawless
And it always feels like I'm hittin' the mark
'Til I go sit in the car, listen and pick it apart
Like, ""This shit is garbage! ""
God's given me all this
Still I feel no different regardless
Kids look to me as a god, this is retarded
If only they knew, it's a facade and it's exhaustive
And I try not to listen to nonsense
But if you bitches are tryin' to strip me of my confidence
Mission accomplished
I'm not God-sent
Nas, Rakim, 'Pac, B. I. G. , James Todd Smith
And I'm not Prince, so
I walk on water
But I ain't no Jesus
I walk on water
But only when it freezes
'Cause I'm only human, just like you
Making my mistakes, oh if you only knew
I don't think you should believe in me the way that you do
'Cause I'm terrified to let you down, oh
It's true, I'm a Rubik's-a beautiful mess
At times juvenile, yes, I goof and I jest
A flawed human, I guess
But I'm doin' my best to not ruin your
Your expectations and meet 'em, but first
The ""Speedom"" verse, now Big Sean
He's goin' too fast, is he gonna shout or curse out his mom?
There was a time I had the world by the balls
eatin' out my palm
Every album song I was spazzin' the fuck out on
And now I'm gettin' clowned and frowned on
But the only one who's looking down on
Me that matters now's Deshaun
Am I lucky to be around this long?
Begs the question though
Especially after the methadone
As yesterday fades and the Dresden home
Is burnt to the ground, and all that's left of my house is lawn
The crowds are gone
And it's time to wash out the blonde
Sales decline, the curtain's drawn
They're closin' the set, I'm still pokin' my head from out behind
And everyone who has doubt, remind
Now take your best rhyme, outdo it
Now do it a thousand times
Now let 'em tell ya the world no longer cares
or gives a fuck about your rhymes
And as I grow outta site, outta mind
I might go outta mine
'Cause how do I ever let this mic go without a fight
When I made a fuckin' tightrope outta twine?
But when I do fall from these heights though, I'll be fine
I won't pout or cry or spiral down or whine
But I'll decide if it's my final bow this time around, 'cause
I walk on water
But I ain't no Jesus
I walk on water
But only when it freezes
'Cause I'm only human, just like you
I've been making my mistakes, oh if you only knew
I don't think you should believe in me the way that you do
'Cause I'm terrified to let you down, oh
If I walked on water, I would drown
'Cause I'm just a man
But as long as I got a mic, I'm godlike
So me and you are not alike
Bitch, I wrote ""Stan"""
Chloraseptic ,Revival,2017,"Instinctive nature to bring the anguish (yeah)
To the English language
With this ink
You haters get rode on like a piece of paper
This rap shit got me travelin' place to place
You barely leave your house
'Cause you're always stuck at your pad
It's stationary
Yeah, that's why when I brainstorm
Gotta write it out
Simon Cowell of rhymin' foul
That's why you sound so shook
Wire bound notebook got tied around your throat
Hook it inside your mouth, go-hruh
That's what it's like when the mic is out
'Cause I'm tearin' at your flesh with it
'Til your larynx and neck are split
With these lyrics, weapons, expert with
Like hair extensions, extra clips
And you're scared to effin' death of it
Bitch, you're starin' at a legend that
In a pair of Skechers, sweatshirt ripped
And hoodie black, should be strapped
To a chair or stretcher
Electric, swear on every record, bitch
Finger so high in the air
I'll bet your senses flip
Like a barometric pressure switch
Carin' less who I offend with this
I'm at your neck like Pez dispense
Go 'head, spit your flow, bitch!
I'm at your throat like chloraseptic, 'septic
And you got strep

Next shit
I'm at your throat

And I'll take a hundred of you, hundred of you
All at once like I had nothin' to lose
What can I do?
My appetite for destruction is loose
Destruction is loose
And all at once just to have somethin' to chew
Somethin' to chew
Somethin' to chew
Yeah, uh
And still conjoined at the hip with hop
still on point and poignant
Skilled as Floyd is
In this field, and still no filter, boy
I'll put you in your place (yeah)
Like a realtor, boy
You still ain't in the buildin', boy
I will destroy shit, even as I build it
Get the drill bit, pen is filled with poison
Which is the source, easy to still pinpoint it
(Like what?) Like a real thin joint it
(What?) Comes on Quilted Northern
(And what?) In a built-in toilet
(Yeah) Bitch, I told you I'm a dog (woof)
I wouldn't heal with ointment
Way I'm kickin' these fairies tails
Should write a children's storybook (yeah)
Million voices in my head
But still get a little bit of thrill
And some real enjoyment
(Off what?) Off the feel of going in
(Like?) Like your bitch when she gives me brain
Like she thinks I'm dumb
Grabs the crown of my dick
And blows me to kingdom come
'Til I feel anointed
She makes iller noises
When she's with me, must be from the Windy City
Pretty apparent
She's a Milf when blowin' me
'Cause I conned her into
Rippin' the condom in two (woo!)
Dick is a bargainin' tool
Now I'm gettin' blew like Klonopins
Rude Jude
I go there, you wouldn't
Well, I still have a few views
In common with you
Just not Youtube, 'cause

That has been the case since back when
You last went and threw your hat in the race
You've been trash (bitch!)
Stick your raps in the trash bin
Or end up in my next rhyme
You're a fuckboy, so next time
It's gonna be heads flyin' like Dez Bryant
With a Tec-9 against Rex Ryan (yeah!)
Now watch me set it like correct time
All you get is sloppy seconds like a Timex
I Clock rejects into the next life
Talking reckless, but it's just my
Strongest suit, but you can get my
Colombian necktie
Prostitute
just climb in the Humvee and let's ride
Why you hitching at night?
I put an end to your life, sex crime
Kidding aside, insidious vibe
Girl, you know you got the prettiest eyes
But all you're getting is bribed
Any old lie to try to get you inside
Then we gon' end up spending the night
And I'm skinning your hide like an Indian tribe
What kind of nut drives a Budweiser truck
Finds a slut, tries to surprise her
Cuffs, ties her up
Binds up, cuts, slices her twice?
But the muff diver must just like it rough
Fuck right in her vagina, blood
Flies up on the visor, like a geyser, uh
(Music, please!) Enthusiast of the roofie
Goal is to get a floozy inside the Jacuzzi
And have a loosey-goosey
As Cool C is with an Uzi
But I am to rap what blue jeans mean
To Bruce Springsteen
Glued we be, I'm trutv
You're too Pg
I'm Schoolly D, you're Spoonie Gee!
No diss there, just notice there
Are no similarities that we share
Besides the fact we breathe air
Happily married to rap
And I'm glad that we buried
The hatchet and patched it up
Now I'm back to ratchet up my attack
And I'm at your mothafuckin' throat like
Chloraseptic, 'septic

I'm at your throat
I'm feelin' reckless, reckless, yeah
And I'll take a hundred of you
Hundred of you
All at once like I had nothin' to lose
What can I do?
My appetite for destruction is loose
Destruction is loose
And all at once just to have somethin' to chew
Somethin' to chew
Somethin' to chew"
Revival (Interlude) ,Revival,2017,"I've drowned in high from the ashes, now
I can't recall your laughter
The smoke of everything, go grasp at ends
Of what's left over
And the lights in every broken
Blown out window screaming, laughing
I hope to feel it coursing out
This is our revival"
Like Home ,Revival,2017,"Yeah
Shout to everybody
Who's been on this trip with me
You don't have to agree
But if you feel like me
Someone get this aryan a sheet
Time to bury him,
so tell him to prepare to get impeached
Everybody on your feet
This is where terrorism and
heroism meets, square up in the streets
This chump barely even sleeps
All he does is watch
Fox News like a parrot and repeats
While he looks like a canary with a beak
Why you think banned
transgenders from the military with a tweet?
He's trying to divide us,
this shit's like a cult
But like Johnny, he'll only unite us
'Cuz nothing drives us inside
like this fight does
Similar to when two cars collide
'cause our spirits are crushed
This spot's a tight one
But here the jaws of life
come to pull us from the wreckage
That's what we get pride from
When we can't wear stars and stripes
'cause this type of pickle
we're in is hard to deal
But there's always tomorrow still
If we start from the scratch
like a scab for scars to heal
And band together for Charolettesville
And for Heather fallen heroes
Fill his wall with murals, Nevada get up
Hit the damn resetter, let's start from zero
This is our renewal, spray tan get ride of
Get a brand new, better, America
And here's to where we're from
This is where it all began, all began
(stand up)
Here's to the land that made me
And made me who I am, who I am
(hands up)
Here's to the land that raised me
There's home for the only place
that really knows me
From the cracks in the road that drove me
There's no place like home
Didn't wanna piss your base off, did ya?
Can't denounce the klan,
'cause they play golf with ya
You stay on Twitter,
way to get your hate off, Nazi
I do not see a way y'all differ
And all you got a race card
biggot, the swastika
with your name carved in it
Should be your trademark,
cause it's all you played off
And you just took the plate off,
so I guess it pays
to feed off of chaos
So basically, you Adolf Hitler
But you ain't ruining our country, punk
You won't take our pride from us
You won't define us
'Cause like a dictionary,
things are looking up
So much, got a sprained neck
Know we would rise up
Against this train wreck
and take a stand
Even if it mean sitting
when they raise the flag
This ain't the Star Spangled Banner
This man just praised
a statue of General Lee, 'cause
He generally hates the black people,
degrades hispanics
Take it back to the Shady national convention
Wish I would have spit on it
before I went to shake his hand at the event
Or maybe had the wherewithal
To know that he was gonna
try to tear apart a sacred land
We cherish and stand for, so
Hands in the air, let's hear it for
The start of a brand new America
Without him, and be proud of where we're from
And here's to where we're from
This is where it all began,
all began (stand up)
Here's to the land that made me
And made me who I am, who I am (hands up)
Here's to the land that raised me
There's home for the only place that really knows me
From the cracks in the road that drove me
There's no place like home
I won't give up
I won't give up on my home,
that so many died for
You already know that I won't give up
I won't give up on my home,
that so many died for
You already know there's no place like home,
no place like home
Wherever I go,
no place like home
No place like home,
no place like home
Wherever I go
This is where it all began, all began
(stand up)
Here's to the land that made me
And made me who I am, who I am (hands up)
Here's to the land that raised me
There's home for the only place that really knows me
From the cracks in the road that drove me
There's no place like home"
Bad Husband ,Revival,2017,"We never saw from each other's sides, or eye to eye
Just eye for eye, lie for lie, fight or flight
So much baggage, need a luggage rack
But we carry on with our public spats and our feuds
Oh, back in the news, love taps when I dissed you
Like it was fun, actually used to run
Back to the booth, jump back in the studio
Give you a tongue lashing then you
Laughed at a stomach tat with the tomb stone
It was funny, back in our youth
But then it wasn't after we knew
That we were done and actually through (and actually through)
But if there's one fraction of truth
If it could be spun back I would do so many things different
'Cause it was such a dumbass excuse
You hit me once, and that I would use
To continue the pattern of abuse
Why did I punch back?
Girls, your dad is a scumbag
I'm confused because
How come you can be a lord and a loser?
How come, how come, you can be a liar and a good father?
A good dad, but a bad husband
Why are you a good father
A great dad, but a bad husband?
You were the beat I love, with a writer's block
Just a line that's hot, that I forgot
We laughed a little, cried a lot
I'll never forget when you came home and you held Hailie
Day before you went to jail and daily
How we would wait for that mail lady
Or by the phone, for mom to call
And I watch you pull yourself up
And we decided on giving it one more try despite it all
You're my lightning rod when my sky gets dark
I'm your shiny rocks in that tiny box
When we tied the knot, when we broke the knot
Every line we crossed, we were supposed to not
Every time we fought, the insults they got
Thrown too far
Words that we said that we didn't mean
The words that we meant that we didn't say
The ones that we thought that should've said
Letters written that we coulda read
Which maybe woulda lead to some good instead
And had this put to bed
But I'd be lying still if I wasn't sitting here asking myself
How come you can be a lord and a loser?
How come, how come, you can be a liar and a good father?
A good dad, but a bad husband
Why are you a good father?
A great dad, but a bad husband
(dad) (you said)
Forever be a hero in my eyes (I reply)
But there's always another side to a good father
A great dad, but a bad husband
We brought out the worst in each other
Someone had to make the sparring end
'Cause I loved you but I hated that me
And I don't wanna see that side again
But I'm sorry Kim
More than you could ever comprehend
Leaving you was fucking harder than
Sawing off a fucking body limb
Once upon a time where all we had
Maybe that was what drew us to each other
It was true love shit that we never knew was possible
We might have loved each other too much
And maybe that's what made us do what we did to each other
All the screw-ups
'Cause you always thought that you was more in love with me
And I was thinking I was more in love than you was
For all the times that we thought it worked
'Til we saw how wrong we were
When the dust settles now and all the dirt
And if I touch the rawest nerve all I want is for us not to hurt
And it's been an exhaustive search to find the words
But I just heard ""Mockingbird""
And got the urge to jot some verses and thoughts
The purpose was not to stir up open wounds
I've caused got a few, and so have you
Or argue whose fault it was, partly yours, partly mine
But really no one's, this is so tough
I'm getting choked up
Oh fuck it, we both suck
We broke up, got back together
We both thought we had forever
Not bad people, just bad together
We were so nuts, backstabbed each other
Another blow struck, but there's no ducking this blow
'Cause it's over, and it's closure
But, I'm not so sure how to close this, I just don't know
How some people can be so good
At one thing and so fucked at a whole 'nother
Shit, it's no wonder
How come you can be a lord and a loser?
How come, how come, you can be a liar and a good father?
A good dad, but a bad husband
Why are you a good father?
A great dad, but a bad husband
(dad) (you said)
Forever be a hero in my eyes (I reply)
But there's always another side to a good father
A great dad, but a bad husband"
Framed,Revival,2017,"Feeling kinky, lip syncing to Too $hort's
""Freaky Tales"" (Biatch!)
Having creepy visions of whiskey drinking
And envisioning sneaking into
where Christie Brinkley dwells
I know this is risky thinking
but I wanna stick her like she's decals
But when murdering females
Better pay attention to these details
or you could be derailed
Better wear at least three layers of clothing or be in jail
If you get scratched because
your Dna'll be all up under her fingernails
Man, he hears you, I don't think he cares
He gives a fuck, even his pinky swears
Three personalities burstin' out of me, please beware
Her Tv blares
can't hear the creaking stairs
She's unaware in no underwear
she's completely bare
Turns around and screams, I remember distinctly
I said: ""I'm here to do sink repairs. ""
Chop her up, put her body parts
in front of Steven Avery's trailer and leave 'em there
But hey man, I was framed
I know what this looks like, officers
Please just give me one minute
I think I can explain
I ain't murdered nobody
I know these words are so nutty
But I'm just here to entertain
How come your shirt is so bloody?
There's a missing person, so what?
He's got nothin' to do with me
I'm almost certain I was framed
Woke up, it was dawn
Musta knew somethin' was wrong
Think I'm becomin' a monster
'cause of the drugs that I'm on
Donald Duck's on
there's a Tonka Truck in the yard
But dog, how the fuck is Ivanka Trump
in the trunk of my car?
Gotta get to the bottom of it to try to solve it
Must go above and beyond
'cause it's incumbent upon me
Plus I feel somewhat responsible
for the dumb little blonde girl
That motherfuckin' baton twirler
that got dumped in the pond
Second murder with no recollection of it
Collectin' newspaper articles, cuttin' out sections from it
Memory's too fucked to remember
Destructive temper
Cut my public defender's jugular
then stuck him up in a blender
Another dismembered toddler
Discovered this winter, probably
'Cause the disassembled body
Was covered up in the snow
since the month of November, oddly
I'm wanted for questioning
Them son of a bitches
probably just wanna pin this on me
But hey man, I was framed
I know what this looks like, officers
Please just give me one minute
I think I can explain
I ain't murdered nobody
I know these words are so nutty
But I'm just here to entertain
How come your shirt is so bloody?
There's a missing person, so what?
He's got nothin' to do with me
I'm almost certain I was framed
Still on the loose, they
Spotted me inside Mcdonald's, Tuesday
In a Toronto Blue Jays cap
lookin' like your college roommate
With Rihanna, Lupe, Saddam Hussein, Bobby Boucher
Or was it Cool J?
The cops is on a goose chase
Just escaped from the state pen
For r'aping eight women who hate men
Don't make it no weirder, I'm naked
When I break in your basement
Under your baby's playpen
I lay in, wait adjacent
Facin' the door, remainin' patient
while stayin' complacent
Blatant sexual implications are continuin' to get thrown
Insinuations are placed in little riddles and poems
Left on your pillow in hopes
That when you get home
You'll get the hint, ho
""I'm in your window""
But it never occurred to me
I could describe a murder scene
In a verse and be charged with first degree
'Cause it just happened to match up perfectly
With the massacre or the Burger King burglary
No, officer, you see
I was framed
I know what this looks like, officers
Please just give me one minute
I think I can explain
I ain't murdered nobody
I know these words are so nutty
But I'm just here to entertain
How come your shirt is so bloody?
There's a missing person, so what?
He's got nothin' to do with me
I'm almost certain I was framed"
Tragic Endings ,Revival,2017,"I'm stumbling, I can't see straight
And it's my fault I got this way
I got my hands on something great
And found a way to mess it all up
I did my best, I tried to change
But it's just in my Dna
I got my hands on something great
And found a way to fuck it up again
Now I'm the one thing
You couldn't hate more
But you're the one thing
That I would die for
All my life, I was told, I was never nothing special
I don't need to be reminded of it every other second
'Specially when all my self-esteem's already shot to hell
I'm falling helplessly, I'm embarrased, I don't want no one else to see
'Cause I feel like I'm a piece of shit, every time she yells at me
Selfishly addicted, but definitely doesn't help that she
Makes me feel like I've died and gone to heaven, but makes life a living hell for me
She does that thing with her lip, now she's melting me
I'm putty in her palms, I'm wrapped around her finger
A yo-yo on a string, she lets me sit there and just dangle
Until something better comes along, and she'll just drop me like a hot potato
I look like I'm in pain, but I'm okay, though
'Cause I know she loves me, my friends, what do they know?
It's like I'm drowning at sea
Hoping that you reach for me
I know you're there but I can't see
'Cause I'm so drunk off tragic endings
I'm dying to breathe
And all you do is strangle me
Such a beautiful relief
'Cause I'm so drunk off tragic endings
Drunk off tragic endings
In my moments of weakness, I openly admit this shit, I wouldn't normally
I'm extremely self-conscious and enormously
Insecure and she uses it to torture when she torments me
It only turns to ammunition for her in this war when she
Gets going, she don't stop, when I'm up, she's like a downer
When I found her it was love at first encounter
Plus, somehow, she must've took the carton of eggs off the counter
Cracked them and placed all the shells on the ground for me to walk on when I'm around her
But there's just something 'bout her
That makes me not able to function without her
How can I get out of it when I don't know how to?
I'm a doubter, I'm a pessimist
Make a believer out of me
And show me the way now
Or stay the fuck out of my cloud of rain
'Cause I'm going straight down the drain
I'm drowning
It's like I'm drowning at sea
Hoping that you reach for me
I know you're there but I can't see
'Cause I'm so drunk off tragic endings
I'm dying to breathe
And all you do is strangle me
Such a beautiful relief
'Cause I'm so drunk off tragic endings
Drunk off tragic endings
Now I'm the one thing
You couldn't hate more
But you're the one thing
That I would die for
It took a while for me to get it, but I think I've figured it out
She don't want me, she just don't wanna see me with someone else
The idea of seeing me happy destroys her in itself
To see me falling to pieces brings her joy, brings her hell
But it annoys her to see me get this straight, then say ""screw her""
I threw up on myself, I'm dumb sick, I'm addicted to her
She's tryna block the door, so here's how I do her
Since I'm manure, she's a sewer
This time, this piece of shit's running through her
I can see the light now, I'm running to it
What the fuck? Shoulda knew it
Who would think she'd actually have the balls to do it?
As soon as I hopped in it, she gassed the car with lighter fluid
She's standing there with a rag, 'bout to put the lighter to it
Lit the fucking thing on fire, then she threw it
It's like I'm drowning at sea
Hoping that you reach for me
I know you're there but I can't see
'Cause I'm so drunk off tragic endings
I'm dying to breathe
And all you do is strangle me
Such a beautiful relief
'Cause I'm so drunk off tragic endings
Drunk off tragic endings"
Nowhere Fast ,Revival,2017,"[pre-chorus: kehlani]
Ashes blowing in the air
I was on fire but we don't care, yeah
Wasted youth, always on the road
Never looking back and we're never getting old
'cause the skies are black
But our hearts made of gold
Fuck doing what you're told
We're going nowhere fast
[verse 1: eminem]
I feel sorry for this beat
Sympathy pains for this track
This road is taking me back
Down memory lane with this rap
I can still look out in this crowd
Be wowed and be taken aback
I'm simply stating a fact
I had wembley stadium packed
But now we're on a path headed
To nowhere and, fast
Another terrorist attacks, like a tariff grows
Half of madison square up, alas
We perish in the blast
But that doesn't scare us
We pass no one, we're failures
'cause we're just
[pre-chorus: kehlani]
Ashes blowing in the air
I was on fire but we don't care, yeah
Wasted youth, always on the road
Never looking back and we're never getting old
'cause the skies are black
But our hearts made of gold
Fuck doing what you're told
We're going nowhere fast
[chorus: kehlani]
'cause we're going no, going no
Going no, going no
Going no, going nowhere
Going nowhere fast
[verse 2: eminem]
Fuck doing what you're told
Act like a two-year old
Shit is soon to go kaboom and blow anyways
For mc's it's a funeral
When I'm devising this rhyme
'cause I'm awake and you're mourning
That's why I rise and I shine
Like a new day has dawned on me
Gusto guts provide oh nuts
And plus I kick up dust and cuss a lot
I must have got you in somewhat of a debacle
'cause some stuff that's awful
Really don't mean nothing all though
There's a lot of shit I said
In jest that's tough to swallow
But if at times my heart
It seems like it's in the wrong place
It's probably cause it's on my sleeve
Keanu reeves speed of life
Avoid or veer or just steer toward it
We're only looking forward but
Where we're going, we have no idea
Nowhere to go but hysterical
It's getting warm in here
I set the world on fire
Was born to be an arsonist
Just one spark and it's lit
But I'ma still get dark on this shit
Told you I'd leave my mark on this bitch
War machine but you've forced me in a corner
I'm sure to have something for your ear
And in the course of the assault is torture
It's more severe
Go to war with me or end up blew to timbuktu
I send at you a ten ton nuke like kim jong-un
And end up blewn in your career (north korea?)
All in all, it's said and done
And at the end of my run, I just rewind clocks
Forever young, make time stop
Will I ever fall off, that day'll never come
To the pine box, bitch fuck you
I'm better than I ever was
'til the bomb drops, hope it never does but
I'm not gonna sweat it 'cause this
World's screwed, it's already fucked
And I'm on top
So everyone's just
[pre-chorus: kehlani]
Ashes blowing in the air
I was on fire but we don't care, yeah
Wasted youth, always on the road
Never looking back and we're never getting old
'cause the skies are black
But our hearts made of gold
Fuck doing what you're told
We're going nowhere fast
[chorus: kehlani]
'cause we're going no, going no
Going no, going no
Going no, going nowhere
Going nowhere fast
[bridge: eminem]
You can't tell us nothing
Hardheaded and we're stubborn
So, working out the other when we're young
Who knows what the future for us could hold
Another shooter, uh oh
And more tomorrow's we're done
And all we are is
[pre-chorus: kehlani]
Ashes blowing in the air
I was on fire but we don't care, yeah
Wasted youth, always on the road
Never looking back and we're never getting old
'cause the skies are black
But our hearts made of gold
Fuck doing what you're told
We're going nowhere fast

Heat,Revival,2017,"Wanna take it from the top?
Lady, you remind me of my raps
on that Relapse shit
'Cause you got an ass thick
as them accents
Two asscheek implants, call that an asset
'Cause you could set a glass on it,
it's massive
From the first time I saw you,
I actually said to myself
""I gotta meet her like a taxi""
Exactly, love affair in the backseat
Sorry if I'm being graphic,
but I'm stiff
as a statue
You sat on a shelf,
I feel like I'm a bust
Maybe I'm just ahead of myself
Let me slow down,
slow your Camaro
I'm tryna catch up, I'm tryna jump
your bones to the marrow
Got me under your control and your spell
Wanna wrap you up, put you
in a bow like an arrow
Grab you by the (meow!)
hope it's not a problem, in fact
About the only thing I agree
on with Donald is that
So when I put this palm on your cat
Don't snap, it's supposed to be grabbed
Why do you think they call it a snatch?
I just wanna climb in the sack
I'mma keep it a hundred,
like my speedometer's at
I'm watching you rap, I'm the
dude following back
About six cars back, I'm in the 'lac
And I want to (uh)
All day, all day, all night
You ask, I stay the night
With you, you say you're fire
Me too, you're burning up
I'm running-
All day, all night
You feel, my heat (fire)
Feel, feel, feel, feel, feel, my heat
Hate to inconvenience you at the
convenience store
But them jeans you wore,
like I've never seen before
I pretend I work there,
while I clean the floor
Checking you out, like the clerk,
while he rings you up
Pull up behind you,
when you're leaving
And you don't even know it
(ayo, Rick, man)
She's brushing her hair,
adjusting her mirror
She's rapping my shit,
but she wasn't aware
I was there, or maybe she was
and just didn't care
Who knows? At least that ain't up in the air
It's something to see
But just like a girl
who thinks her coochie doesn't stink
If she ain't planning to do
shit, this summer's eve
Maybe she wants to keep me company
But fuck the Pepé Le Pew shit
""Ain't stepping to you bitch,""
I say to myself
Plus she's bumping my music,
ain't chasing no tail
Like a skunk in heat
I could sweat her, to some degree
But fuck it, I'm the male,
let her come to me
Let her come to me,
male sweater, some degree, fail
Fuck it, pull up beside her
Sideswipe her, Dodge Vipe-her
What is a [?]
Asked if she wants a computer
lodged in her vagina
Said my dick is an apple
She said, ""put it inside her""
I said-
All day, all day, all night
You ask, I stay the night
With you, you say you're fire
Me too, you're burning up
I'm running-
All day, all night
You feel, my heat (fire)
Feel, feel, feel, feel, feel, my heat
Black out, come to, hands
covered in blood
Motherfucking gloves and a shovel
stuck in the mud
I just bodied the beat,
so that hoe must've been dug
'Cause it just died like ""ooh,
food coloring, duh!""
So let's get turnt, like a
shish kebab, twist it, Ma
Like an air-conditioning knob
We be great together
Don't care if it takes forever
If I gotta wait, I guess it's better
late than never
You felt my heat, rubbing off on you
I love your personality
Come on, little mama, you're hot
enough to melt Rick's beat
Come jump in the water,
I bet you get your self esteem
From your persona
With an ass to match, girl,
your body is lit
You're striking, I'm a gas
Girl, you're just gonna have to
put the mother chumps on the back burner
You got buns,
I got Asperger's
Just let me rest my head in
between that set of Ds
While I shred Mcs
like cheddar cheese
That's just the thoroughbred
in me, ain't a better breed
My dog thinks so, too,
look at my pedigree
Ma, the world is what I think of you
I think you're divine, so
I might swing on you
I'm just kidding girl,
I wouldn't lift a finger or two
Unless it's the middle one,
to finger you
All day, all day, all night
You ask, I stay the night
With you, you say you're fire
Me too, you're burning up
I'm running-
Feel, feel, feel, feel,
feel, my heat
On the ones and twos, threes
and four in (the morning)
Rick's in the cut like Neosporin (what?)
He's mixing it up for me and Lauren
A teddy like short for Theodore
We're outtie, five thousand
Who the fuck? It's my big dick
So everybody get ready right-fucking-now"
Offended,Revival,2017,"You claim if you get knocked by the cops
You'll give 'em not even a statement
Walk in the arraignment, shoot the bailiff
Karate kick the plaintiff
Gotti with the stainless
I'll just call it shoddy entertainment
If y'all was in the party gettin' faded
On molly, had the audience sedated
You wouldn't catch a body if it fainted
Probably let it fall and hit the pavement
But you'd be the first lobbyin' to claim it
Bitch, stop bein' a lame
Your hobby isn't robbery and dismemberin' body limbs
Like you was Tommy Lynn Sells
And chainsawing them in the basement
Hardly fits your job description
Ain't nobody dippin' out the back of the club like, ""Oh my God, he's trippin'""
Only time you get the blade is probably with the dang lawn equipment, ain't it?
Wouldn't take a bobby pin and wave it
I need to stop bein' debated
You're still copyin', Xeroxing, I'm still coppin' a feel
Like Bill Cosby at will, popping a pill then spill Oxys in Jill's coffee
Then send her out to the hotel lobby a lil' wobbly and still groggy
This blonde fucks reprehensible misconducts, never sensible
Kiss my butt, my set of principles is gone
But till I get the President to respond
My pen and pencil is a missile launcher
And send it to Mitch Mcconnell
Just as big of a bitch as Donald
Shit's on, bruh
Let me sing this shit soprano
While I do it pizzicato
Ivanka, stiff arm her
While I'm hittin' on Melania
And this song's for all ya
'Cause nobody likes me, everybody hates me
They want me to go eat some worms
I hope you offended
And drag my name through the mud, through the dirt
But I'ma make you eat your words
I hope you offended
You can try to hold me down, but you better let me up
'Cause you're only gonna make things worse
I hope you offended
'Cause I swear when I get up I'm never gonna let up
'Til everybody eats my turds
These drums and hard snares bring out the worst in me
Like Justin Ross Harris at a nursery
Goin' ham at candy yam on nanny cam
I'm gettin' handys with the zanny Xannys in the Caddy armrest
I'm imagining objects, so I'm batting cobwebs
From a daddy longleg
And Hamtramck, got the panoramic camera
Xanax, a banana hammock and a Santa hat
I'm smellin' like a damn mechanic
With a chick that looks like Janet Jackson with a Spanish accent
Twice your age and I'm actin' half it
Grow up? Nah
Not that I know of, y'all
Basement just got a frickin' overhaul, got a stripper pole installed
Started rollin' all through those Kolonopins like a bowlin' ball
Like an overdose on twice the ratio of Propofol and go through no withdrawal
While I get fellatio and give a facial to an interracial blow-up doll of Rachel Dolezal
You're so appalled (Em), so's my manager
Bitch I'm amateur, fuck a pro career
Coast is clear, but nowhere to go from here
And nobody's close, so don't compare
They ain't nowhere near, I'm way over here
My competition can't see me
'Cause I don't own a mirror
But Marshall, you are terrific, so smart and gifted
I'm so narcissistic, when I fart, I sniff it
Do a fake dab to smell my armpits with it
Your anxiety's throwin' gang signs
But I made strides with these rape lines
I'm cuttin' back on women hate crimes
Like Ray Rice when he Facetimes
Bang, bang, bang, bang time
Dang knives to butcher them gay wives
You're gonna need sutures the same size
As the blade I push into captcha
Pull 'em like... sleigh rides
Gotta stab a bitch at least eight times
To make it on Dateline
I came to stake my claim like a canine
Waitin' in a buffet line
So Kellyanne Conway, I'm a really bad hombre
Come play, belly dance on me
I've been making wedding plans all day
'Cause nobody likes me, everybody hates me
They want me to go eat some worms
I hope you offended
And drag my name through the mud, through the dirt
But I'ma make you eat your words
I hope you offended
You can try to hold me down, but you better let me up
'Cause you're only gonna make things worse
I hope you offended
'Cause I swear when I get up I'm never gonna let up
'Til everybody eats my turds
Eight year old with the wordplay
Girl, take this pole like a survey
Today wasn't my birthday
But I'm caked up like a dessert tray
So we're in shape
'Cause you're in a slurrin' state
I'm a ten, you're an eight, like what I do before, after, and during rape
You wanna get into a pissin' contest and find out who's better?
And they made a fool out of what I pulled out him
R. Kelly with a full bladder
Not in high school, grad, I'm not a scholar
But I'm so cold that I'm droppin' knowledge my degrees
It's the same as I got in college
(Zero)
But nobody's hotter, you owe me my respect
I owe you nada like lodi partner that blow me
Told you I'm so dirty, homie you can throw me in some holy water
With some floaties on
And get the soap, and try to get the Pope to hold me
While you hose me off And nope I won't be washed
You hope to God I don't explode, I gotta blow this spot up, though
I got a lotta more
I won't put the sugar coating on it though
'Cause sometimes you can feel like your energy's expired
Rap's got you drained, dead tired, zapped
You feel like a wet pile of crap
But look, man, like the feds buggin' my phone, uh huh
I get why you're tapped
But you gotta get your fire back
Catch fire, get upset and fire back
Is what I tell myself
When times get bad
'Cause sometimes I might get sad
Well I take the same advice I had
And tell myself like I used to tell Hailie, when life's a drag
Told her to do like her dad, don't cry, get mad
'Cause little baby powders belong in diaper bags
I'm hyper, by the time you see this side of me
I'm right in your ass
'Fore the pen, I stood up for the kid who had to put up with the bullies at his school (at his school)
You ain't have to have no money or go shoppin' just to cop a fuckin' attitude
Now my dough's amountin' to a mountain, it's rised too high to count it
Never asked to be rich, all I did was wish I had a dime for every time that I was doubted
But then I think about it and I'm enraged
'Cause I just figured out that if I was paid
For the time I spent to put the pen to the page
It'd be minimum wage
But it's embedded in my head and I never hunted for the bread and butter
What I wanted was to be the one that they was scared of
But I'm never gonna get the credit for the sweat and blood I put up in the pen
And when I'm dead I wonder will they put me on a pedestal
Or forget I was ever this incredible
I guess I better go harder than ever 'cause I'll never get
Another mothafuckin' opportunity again
To offend as many people with this I can, simply because I can
'Cause nobody likes me, everybody hates me
They want me to go eat some worms
I hope you offended
And drag my name through the mud, through the dirt
But I'ma make you eat your words
I hope you offended
You can try to hold me down, but you better let me up
'Cause you're only gonna make things worse
I hope you offended
'Cause I swear when I get up I'm never gonna let up
'Til everybody eats my turds"
Need Me ,Revival,2017,"You are drunk, the coffee is burned
I hate to find you like this
I always find you like this
I come home and clean up your mess
What would you do without that?
Why do I always come back?
Oh, what I wouldn't do for you
And I'm starting to think
that maybe you need me
Maybe you need me
Maybe you need me
And I'm starting to think
that maybe you need me
Maybe you need me
Maybe you need me
Some nights I want to run for the hills
It's never easy with you
I cannot reason with you
But your smile is as rare as it comes
What would I do without that
Maybe that's why I come back
Oh, what I wouldn't do for you
And I'm starting to think
that maybe you need me
Maybe you need me
Maybe you need me
And I'm starting to think
that maybe you need me
Maybe you need me
Maybe you need me
Starting to think we were made
for each other
But one of us in this relationship
is raising the other
You remind me of my mother
We drive one another crazy as each other
And we're both adults so there's
no excuse for the games
that we play with each other
Where you at? At a friend's?
No, you ain't, motherfucker
But I give her the benefit of the doubt
Whenever the doubt kicks in, shiver
When I touch her,
'cause I love her so much, I'm a sucker
Our bottom lip can quiver
when she's in trouble,
she's in hot water
Think I caught her cheating again
Give her another chance?
Another one after that?
I'm swimming in that Egyptian river,
'cause I'm in denial
Say I don't eat shit,
but I got a shit-eating grin
when I smile
Making an excuse for us to act it out
She's just acting out, with her inner child
Then I set the truth on fire
Cause I'd rather believe a lie then
I breathe a sigh of relieve that
I don't believe in
Going to bed mad
I keep on trying
to make a bad girl good
But haven't I stood by you in good times?
And bad?
I'm starting to feel like
your god damn dad
'Cause I literally
feel like you could die
""Should I leave me for good?""
You never would
It'd be all bad
Never understood why they call it goodbye
But I think I'm a pretty damn good guy
And you're a good person, too
I can save you, I can make you change
But I keep putting my fucking foot in my mouth
Every time I gotta come and bail you out
When you get in trouble that you get yourself in
And I'm in trouble but I can't leave
I'll sell you out!
I could never turn my fuckin' back on you
What is that?
I'm co-dependent, I'm just now noticing it
But somehow it's like every time
I'm about to go to end it
I ain't got the cojones to do it
Nor the heart,
our apartment's tore apart
You're using my heart for a dart board
But God must've aligned stars for us
'Cause somebody paired us up
And they say he ain't
capable of making a mistake
But this one's perfect
'Cause I'm...
And I'm starting to think
that maybe you need me
Maybe you need me
Maybe you need me
And I'm starting to think
that maybe you need me
Maybe you need me
Maybe you need me"
In Your Head,Revival,2017,"In your head, in your head
Zombie, zombie, zombie-ie-ie
What's in your head? In your head?
Zombie, zombie, zombie-ie-ie, oh
I'm packin' up my shit
As much shit in the car as I can fit
And I'm just drivin' as far as I can get
Away from these problems
T'il all of my sorrows I forget
What's tomorrow like? 'Cause tonight
I'm startin' life again
Get to the corner and stop, fuck am I goin'?
Besides psycho when I fantasize
Startin' my whole life over
Yeah right
Oh and I might go and
Get hypnotized so I don't even recognize no one
I try to look alive but there's nothin' like
Holdin' your head up high when you're dead inside
And I just hide, so in case you're wonderin'
Why my insides showin'
'Cause I done spilled all my guts
And those are mine so I'm
Pickin' them up and stuffin' them back
Fuck it, I've done enough in this rap shit
Recovery brought me nothin' but back
To right where I was and perhaps
This coulda been my victory lap
If I wasn't on the verge of relapse
What's in your head, in your head
Zombie, zombie, zombie-ie-ie
What's in your head, in your head
Zombie, zombie, zombie-ie-ie, oh
It seems to be the reoccurring main theme
The shit I would daydream as a kid
I was eighteen I went from an irate teenager
To still raging, isn't it though amazing?
Back then I put anything into the rhyme
Whether it was sad, mad, happy or angry
I spit it, the mainstream, I hit it
Yay me, I did it
Did what?
Hailie, baby, I didn't mean to make you
Eighty percent of what I rapped about
Maybe I shoulda did a better job
At separating Shady and entertaining
From real life but this fame thing
Is still the hardest thing to explain
It's the craziest shit I ever seen
And back then it was like I ain't even
Bothered taking into consideration you one day
Being older and may hear me say things
I didn't (A) mean and (B) just ain't me
Okay, so ladies and gentlemen
Let's strip away
Everything and see the main reason that I
Feel like a lame piece of shit
I sound cranky and bitter
Complain, beef and bicker 'bout the same things
'Cause when I look at me
I don't see what they see
I feel ashamed, greedy and lately
I've been contemplating escaping to get away
And go wherever this road takes me
It's making me crazy, what's in my
What's in your head, in your head
Zombie, zombie, zombie-ie-ie
What's in your head, in your head
Zombie, zombie, zombie-ie-ie, oh"
Castle,Revival,2017,"I built this castle, now we are trapped on the throne
I'm sorry, we're alone
I wrote my chapter
You'll turn the page when I'm gone
I hope you'll sing along
This is your song
I just want you to know that I ain't scared
Whatever it takes to raise you, I'm prepared
To do whatever, to do whatever
December 1st, 1995, dear Hailie
This is your song
You'll be coming out of mommy's stomach soon
I better do something quick if I'ma be able to support you
I can barely support me, but as long as you're healthy
That's all that matters for the time being
But obviously, assuming you will be, just thinking ahead
I'ma make it if it kills me
Let's see how far I can take it with this music
I'm getting sick of chasing this illusion
Sorry for sloppy writing
The pen in my hand's shaking, please excuse me
Dad's a little nervous, but at the same time excited
If I use this same energy while I'm saying rhymes and write 'em
With the same passion and the same exact enthusiasm
As I'm using in this letter maybe they can feel me as I'm
Trying to build these castles out of sand, baby girl
For you to sit on the throne, I got plans, baby girl
Welcome to mom and dad's crazy world
Love, daddy
Maple flavored kisses, buttered pancakes, and syrup
I built this castle, now we are trapped on the throne
I'm sorry, we're alone
I wrote my chapter

To do whatever, to do whateverdecember 1st, 1996, dear Hailie
You got your momma's personality, same eyes as I got
Her beautiful smile, but your ears are the same size as mine are
Sorry for that, a little minor mishap
But you'll grow into 'em baby
I'm on the grind now
I'm doing little shows, open mics, all-nighters at studios
While I'm tryna keep the lights on
Why does it seem like I'm so close to this dream, yet so far?
I just keep steering
I'm gonna turn into someone
I haven't the slightest clue what I'm gonna do if it falls through
You took your first steps today, you'll probably walk soon
My Infinite Cd flopped, too many soft tunes
They're talking bad about dad, it's ticking me off too
Makes me feel like I don't belong or something, ooh
I think I might have just stumbled onto something new
Got a prediction for the future, I'm hoping it's you
Open this envelope when you're older and it holds true
I built this castle, now we are trapped on the throne
I'm sorry, we're alone

December 24th, 2007, dear Hailie
Now if you found these letters, I guess I better try to explain
A lot's happened in between 'em, since I rised to this fame
I've said your name but always tried to hide your face
This game is crazy, I wanted to claim my love for you but damn
I never knew it'd be like this
If I did I wouldn't have done it
You ain't asked for none of this shit
Now you're being punished?
Things that should've been private with me and your mother is public
I can't stomach, they can take this fame back, I don't want it
I'll put out this last album then I'm done with it
One-hundred percent finished
Fed up with it, I'm hanging it up, fuck it
Excuse the cursing, baby, but just know
That I'm a good person, though they portray me as cold
And, if things should worsen, don't take this letter I wrote as a goodbye note
'Cause your dad's at the end of his rope
I'm sliding down a slippery slope
Anyways sweetie, I better go, I'm getting sleepy
Love dad
Shit, I don't know"
Arose,Revival,2017,"If I could rewind time like a tape,
inside a boombox
One day for every pill, or percocet that I ate
Cut down on the valium, that'll hurt everything
But death is turning so definite, wait
They got me all hooked up to some machine
I love you, being, didn't want you to
know I was struggling
Feels like I'm underwater submerged
like a submarine
Just heard that nurse say, my liver
and kidneys aren't functioning
Been flirtatious with death, skirt-chasing,
I guess
It's arrivederci, same nurse,
just heard say they're unplugging me
And it's your birthday, Jade,
I'm missing your birthday
Baby girl, I'm sorry, I fucking hate
when you hurt, Hai
And sweeties, thank you for waiting to
open gifts
But, girls, you can just open 'em, dad
ain't making it home for Christmas
Wish I had the strength to just blow a kiss
I go to make a fist, but I can't make one,
I'm frozen stiff
I yell, but nothing comes out,
I'm crying inside, I shout
My vocal cords won't permit me,
I scream, but it's not allowed
You put your arm around mama, the karma, wow
I just thought about the aisle,
I'll never get to walk us down
Never see you, graduate in your caps and gowns
It's 'bout to be 2008, how's this happening now?
I've got so much more to do, and Proof, I'm truly sorry
If I let you down, but this tore me in two
The thought of no more me and you
You gave me shoes, Nikes like
new for me for school
Doody, I'm trying, but you, you
were the glue that binded
So many things, time, I'd give
anything to rewind it
I had to walk down my halls and
constantly be reminded
By pictures all on my walls and
I couldn't sleep at night 'cause
That image burned in my brain of you on the table
Me falling across your body,
not able to stand to save you
God, why did you take him?
I'm tryna keep his legacy alive,
but I'm dying, where's Nathan?
Little ladies, be brave, take
care of your mother
Smile pretty for pictures, always
cherish each other
I'll always love ya, and I'll be in the back of your memory
And I know you'll never forget me, just don't get sad when remembering
And, little bro, keep making me proud
You better marry that girl 'cause
she's faithfully down
And when you're exchanging those
sacred vows, just know that if I could be there
I would and should you ever see
parenthood, I know you'll be good at it
Oh, almost forgot to do something,
thank my father too
I actually learnt a lot from you,
you taught me what not to do
And Mom, wish I'd have had the chance
To have one last heart-to-heart
honest and open talk to you
Doody, I see you, I go to walk to you
And I can feel my soul leave my
body and float across the room
Nurses lean over the bed, pulling tubes out
Then the sheet over my head, shut
the room down
Girls, please don't get upset,
I see them cheeks soaking and wet
As you squeeze hold of my neck,
so forcibly, don't wanna let
Me go, pillow drenched, emotional wrecks
With every second, each closer to death
But suddenly, I feel my heart begin to beat slow
Then a breath, machines go (*beep beep beep*)
Must've guessed the cheat codes to this shit
I'm tryna rewind time like a tape, find an escape
Make a beeline, try and awake
From this dream, I need to re-find
My inner strength, to remind me
Even if a steep climb I must take
To rewrite a mistake, I'm rewinding the tape
(I don't want it)
I'll put out this last album,
then I'm done with it
One hundred percent finished, fed up with it
I'm hanging it up, fuck it
Excuse the cursing, baby,
but just know
That I'm a good person, though
they portray me as cold
And if things should worsen, but I bet you they won't
I'm pledging to throw this
methadone in the toilet
Shred these old letters I wrote
All that old pathetic loathing,
closing credits can roll
I'm proud to be back, I'm 'bout to,
like a rematch
Outdo Relapse
With Recovery, Mathers Lp2
Help propel me to victory laps
Gas toward them and fast forward the past
Consider the last four minutes as
The song I'd have sang to my daughters
If I'd have made it to the hospital
Less than two hours later, but I fought it
Came back like a boomerang on 'em
Now a new day is dawning, I'm up,
Tuesday, it's morning
Now I know"
Shady Xv,Shady XV,2014,"[Verse 1]
I'm liable to start a violent spark with a silent thought
I disgust you like dialogue from the shop to The Wired Frog
Night club, shit, I was taught if you see these on fire
You had to put it out yourself like Highland Park, no fire department
So you may not hear sirens at all
But don't be alarmed if I sound off
Something just ain't right with me, dawg
A martyr on a private charter, whose life could be harder
Widely regarded, highly bite me, sweetheart, I'm slightly retarded
But tonight I'm starting shit, I'm feeling self righteous
I might just hop in a mosh pit on some Mike Tyson and Pac shit
Looking to box with anybody, disorderly conduct
I'll fuck around and snort a key and pick a fight with a locksmith
Fan of the Lox, bananas, manic, I'm going in shock
Frantic, I'm trapped in a closet
Panic attack cause I'm claustrophobic
No, faggot, I mean I can't maneuver from movement
Cause I had no room for improvement
I'm practically squashed, unpacked it and boxed it
Toxic, hands are arsenic, flammable bars, examine the content
Bar exam, start of insanity
Charles Hamilton slash Manson and Bronson
Animal snarls, cannibal jaws
Shark mandibles, lambs that'll slaughter
Looking scamp as Hannibal stalking
Anthony Hopkins with his hands in his pockets
Black out, Zach Galifianakis, gallons of Vodka
But I gallon some knockers
I bet you they ring a bell when I come back and I'm conscious
What happened, doc? I passed out again
Alcohol's making me break into vacant's naked
Stole a Magnum box and bag Cirocs in back of a Doxon
Fell asleep watching Fear Factor and Scare Tactics
Too close to the stair master
Poked a hole in the air mattress and popped it
Woke up shortly there after, hungover
No one to wear, grasping a bear, rasped it and dropped it
Air Max in my closet, preposterous Nikes made out of ostrich
And the cross stitching is a cross mix
Of a rhinoceros, possum skin, giraffe and a dolphin
Dolphin fin dockers, eyes cautious, drop crotches
Swats watches and sneakers matches with the parkers
But it's like being overstepped at a boxing gym
With all these trainers, but I don't have any boxers
And I'm standing here naked, hangover, still wasted
Like paper you write raps on, obnoxious
Yo, why does it always sound like I'm grabbing my nostrils?
Fuck that, I'll battle 'em all, I'll battle 'em all
I'll stand there and yell mad at a wall
Until the mannequin doll scatter the inanimate objects
That I'm badder than all, shatter and fall
Cause I hear the track
And I'm starting to get fucking amped, I'mma spark plug
Like the car with the cables hooked to my fucking back, I'm a Duracell
But I sure as hell got it backwards cause y'all could get jumped
And I'd catch the battery charge, but
I got a hunch like your back when it's arching
When I start attacking your squadron
You'll feel like Master Card when I'm charging
So take a swipe at me, I'm coming straight at you
Like Clay Matthews from the Green Bay Packers
So get the sack of Wisconsin
That's nutbag that I'm talking, who am I kidding?
You faggots are all gonna do my bidding
Don't get dragged to the auction
Neiman Marcus, bags of the Tylenol
I'll push a bitch into oncoming traffic, just watch this
Stretched, tinted, black sedan my ass
See I'm at you wack when I drop you off at Saks Fifth Ave
In a fucking taxi cab to go shopping
Affable guy next door is laughable
My next whore's gon' have mechanical arms
That'll jack me off with a lotion dispenser with a motion sensor
No emotion hence I guess this sick prick dies hard
I got a Magic Johnson
It's like a Magic Wand allows me to not let a blonde arouse me
If Ronda Rousey was on the couch, with the condoms out
Holding a thousand Magnums at once to pounce me
I laugh in response to how she dances and flaunts it around me
Her flat little badonkadonk is bouncing around
And all I see is [?] she's slaughterhouse in a blouse
And Madonna with mud on her, got dammit I am misogynist
I slap Linda Ronstadt with a lobster, throw her off a balcony
Just so happens she's fond of Al
Cause now she's faceplants on the concrete
Complete lack of responsibility
Half you assholes ain't strong enough to pick up a spirit
Shit, you faggots couldn't shoplift at a thrift shop
But I let the track lift 'em up, boost the energy
Klepto, I'm back to rip shop up, but my thing is this now
Five finger discount
Been rapping so long I've been killing this shit, it's easy
Kidnapping your mom cause I'm still in this bitch, thievery
Ransom for Jonbenét Ramsey, Chandra Levy, and Gary Condit
Paul was scared that if I went back to the blonde
I might relapse, get to some bullshit
Perhaps I'll launch some cracker taunts at Action Bronson
Macklemore and Mac Miller and Asher Roth
Have some back and forths
And record a wack response to Kendrick Lamar's Control verse
And perform Fack in concert
[Fack plays]
Yo, I put that shit on a Greatest Hits album
Now that was awesome
It takes some massive balls to do some shit like that
Sometimes I have to ponder why people are like
(I'll stick around)
And put up with my crap so long for
What's the attraction, mama?
Is it the fact that I'm a walking, talking, actual quadruple entendre
Or the pointy nose that's pointing at you, mama?
Who knows at this point, it's always poking so meh
Still get along with this voice cause that's the monster
So do-si-do with a sociopath, everyone who knows me knows that
What they don't know is the fact Rihanna calls me Pinocchio, meh
She loves the way I lie
Sits on my face and waits for my nose to grow
Pathological liar, oh, why am I such an asshole
That might've disguise pants, but they on fire
So am I-a, wooh, Cappadonna, cut the track off
Sabotage Christmas, crap in your stocking
I'm wrapping up all the presents
In fucking camouflage so you can't even find 'em
Jack Santa Claus, snap Rudolph's antlers off
Wrap his schnoz in gauze bandage and blind him
Blowing the head gasket at Bed, Bath and Beyond
Put the basket back while the bath salt packets are gone
Know you really tired of me sampling Billy Squier
But classic rock acid rap is the genre
Got Slash on guitar, splashing Bizarre, Trasher and Aerosmith
And I'm a spectacular archer, feed count Dracula Chocula
Godzilla, half dragon and Bob Dylan
Bandwagoners kicking the damn stragglers off and I'm strangling 'em
Smack Kim Basinger on the ass"
Psychopath Killer ,Shady XV,2014,"[Royce da 5'9""]
I guess you could consider it poetry
But with me it started out with just words, just words
They started looking like puzzle pieces
So I started connecting them to each other
'Til they started to resemble blank canvases
By this time I was an artist
So I just started to see these pictures, these real visuals
I'm a psychopath, I'm a killer
[Yelawolf]
(I'm a psychopath, I'm a killer
I'm a psychopath, I'm a killer
A psychopath, I'm a killer
A psychopath, I'm a killer)
Feelin' it in the air, breathe it in the night
Sayin' I'm a killer
Did you ever think you would come to find?
Maybe in my dreams
[Royce da 5'9""]
I'm a psychopath, I'm never keepin' it plain
Lyrical murder is somethin' I've been about
Ever since I was a little kid, doodlin' in class
Drew a picture of my teacher, bullet in his head
Ruler in his ass
With a toilet in front of him, throwin' up, pissed off
Prolly symbolic of this thought, sick tot
To my inner enemy in a rush
I'm havin' nightmares of leavin' behind my dreams
With anything less than a full bank
It's like I'm General Hong, and I'm standin' in front of a gun
I'm puttin' myself in the way of a bullet to pull rank
The hood is over my eyes but the wool ain't
Yeah, got the mentality of bein' with a wizard
Every award show, we don't even get considered
How do you sell somethin' that's so lyrical
To a kid who wouldn't know what was hittin' if it hit him?
Now I wanna talk about these niggas from Detroit
Beef on me and Shady who was thinkin' 'bout Detroit
We put the world onto it so watch how you say ""fuck me""
You just might jinx yourself, whoop, your girl gon' do it
Cause I was in that 911 in Chicago, 911 at the same time
I had already been grindin' since '97, that's longevity
And if you think you're lyrically better, you better be a killer
[Yelawolf]
(I'm a psychopath, I'm a killer)
You ain't ever seen a motherfucker get realer
(A psychopath, I'm a killer)
Pull an automatic on anybody sporadic I choose
(A psychopath, I'm a killer)
Cause ain't nobody iller, no one, nobody for realer
(A psychopath, I'm a killer)

Welcome to the slaughterhouse
Niggas try to tell me I spell too much

Ho, U-S-E, now go to hell you fucks, word

Money like Dracula, hand him some spatula
Ask me a question

Then I'm lightin' up the street
CROOKED going Michael Jackson on Thriller
I'm a psychopath, I'm a killer
[Yelawolf]
(I'm a psychopath, I'm a killer)
You ain't ever seen a motherfucker get realer
(A psychopath, I'm a killer)
Pull an automatic on anybody sporadic I choose
(A psychopath, I'm a killer)
Cause ain't nobody iller, no one, nobody for realer
(A psychopath, I'm a killer)
Feelin' it in the air, breathe it in the night
Sayin' I'm a killer
Did you ever think you would come to find?
Maybe in my dreams
[Eminem]
The thought of retiring
Is makin' me want to set your daughter on fire
With a soldering ironing
What up mom, applyin' for the rim job, are you hirin'?
I'm hopin' to fill up your opening
Oh but I know I gotta meet a lot of requirements
First I gotta accept you in the lobby and the aisle and
You've probably already been with all the slaughter
And I am in
No mood to be playin' second fiddle, slob on this violin
With no strings attached
I'm just the product of a hostile environment
But bein' brought up so brought up inspired
But I don't know why
It's still like I'm caught up inside a whirlpool
Not an appliance, but applyin' this science
I psychotically rhyme
And it's like stars have aligned all in alliance
Heart of a lion, balls of Goliath
Obscene talkin', the twine like a beanstalk and the vine
But I keep walkin' the line between the wrong and the right
But everything I write seems wrong and it's like
I'm ecstatic at all the static that I can still cause
In the fabric of our modern society
Now Catholics are panicking
Cause I snapped back to my old antics and shenanigans
Dammit, the Pope's mad again
Probably shouldn't have ran up in the Vatican
With that mannequin
Singin' ""Bagpipes from Baghdad"" again
In my dad's drag draggin' a faggot in a Glad bag
Won't be the last time I make a dramatic entrance
Like that again
You thought I was lyin'
When I said I think that I'm crossin' the line again
I've lost my mind, caution oh God
I think I've just thought of another fucking line
Forgive me father, for I have sinned
But hip hop has left me brainwashed with a violent streak
Defiant, now the odds of me tryin' to fuckin' be quiet
Probably gotta be 'bout as high as the Jolly Green Giant
After he's fallen in pollen next to a killer bee hive colony
Tryin' to sneak by it
While his feet stomp, follow me while I revive rap
I'ma start up a rioting, try to stop it or silence it
You're not gonna, might as well
Just hit the block in your joggin' attire in
Boston, across the marathon finish line and I
Put your thoughts against mine
Cause the arsenal I have'll scar you for life
Worse than Dzhokhar's
And I have a bomb, pliers and barbed wire
Your bars are like Barney Fife
With a fucking swiss army knife
A saber that's Darth Vader with arthritis at a bar fight
With the Dark Knight on a dark night with his arms tied up
I'm Dahmer-like when I'm on the mic, I'm not gonna lie
I perform like I'm gonna die at the end of a song
So it's hard for the rhyme to end
Like fuck 'em all I'm just ridin
Like I'm locked up inside a shot up Bonnie and Clyde car
Uncle Ronnie is driving
'Bout to burst in through the side door
Of Arkham Asylum and park in the dining room
[Yelawolf]
(I'm a psychopath, I'm a killer)
You ain't ever seen a motherfucker get realer
(A psychopath, I'm a killer)
Pull an automatic on anybody sporadic I choose
(A psychopath, I'm a killer)
Cause ain't nobody iller, no one, nobody for realer

Die Alone ,Shady XV,2014,"[Eminem]
I roll over and go to reach for you, you're gone
This bed's empty without you
You said you're moving on
But I'm having some trouble getting there
But dwelling ain't getting me, uhh, anywhere
Fuckin' Valentine's Day
Fuck February, stuffed teddy bear, guts everywhere
Machete on the floor, I smashed up every mirror
Yeah, how do I look?
You fuckin' just let me here to die didn't you?
Why didn't you respond yet?
I've written you five or six different times and
I'm gettin' sick and tired of always apologizing to you
I didn't do shit to deserve what you're puttin' me through
This couldn't be true, we can't be over
So violets are blue, roses are red
Why is it everything I do I'm reminded of you?
[Kobe]
Saw two white coffins in my dreams last night
I saw my Lord Jesus with his hands pointing toward the light
Saw my old sweetheart she said, ""honey, I'm back""
Just so you don't die alone, just so you don't die alone
[Eminem]
Guess I gotta deal with the fact that
You ain't never comin' back
Now every woman that I look at I'm lookin' for you
So I'm findin' something the matter with them
Excuse to not see anyone
Useless, rather pick up the phone, not at all
Followin' protocol
I get bowled like bowling balls
Grow balls and go to call to talk, forget what I want to say
Damnit I'm drawin' blanks like I'm playin' hangman
I'm sick of playin' these games
I can't handle this heartbreak
It's makin' me wanna blow out my brains
Like birthday cake candles
Hang up the phone and I shake
I think I may have made a mistake
Can't escape the madness
Turn the radio on, I hate this sad song
But I can't even change the station
The same one's playin' on eight channels
I lay awake in shambles, I'm startin to hallucinate
I'm havin' all these visions of us at each other's wakes
In caskets and suddenly I wake and that's when I know I
Saw two white coffins in my dreams last night
I saw my Lord Jesus with his hands pointing toward the light
Saw my old sweetheart she said, ""honey, I'm back""
Just so you don't die alone, just so you don't die alone
Give me one more, bottle for the pain
Give me one more for the memories
Give me one more, I'll make it taste like a steak
It'll help alleviate
It'll soothe this ache
Of trying to fake
That she's really, she's really coming back
[Eminem]
And it's been a while now, but I finally realize how
Much reality sucks, but it's just something about our love
I'm still in denial now, dealing with the finality of it
And it's making me crazy thinking of the days we, spent
And how I'll never hold you again
And there ain't shit I can do about it
Now my head is overcrowded
With these clouded memories
And I can't seem to get you out it
And how the fuck do you sleep comfortably
Knowing what you done did to me, huh?
Did it even occur to you that I loved you?
Completely, deep, and madly head over heels for you
Was you and me, wants us to be together forever
It was supposed to be us, but you crushed the dream
We was supposed to die together, and it's killing me so much
When I sleep I wake up dead, must be why I
Saw two white coffins in my dreams last night
I saw my Lord Jesus with his hands pointing toward the light
Saw my old sweetheart she said, ""honey, I'm back""
Just so you don't die alone, just so you don't die alone"

Got a shit-eatin' grin
Bitch, show me them itty-bitty titties again
We're in Sin City
Since when did we begin to get 'dicted to dope
Diggity, bitch, you need to run
And go get your frigity-friends
I'm lookin' at your bum-stickity-bum, hun
The mickity mack's bickity back, don't act wickity-wack
You can get the fickity-finger; the middle
You little dizzy bitch, sit and spig-a-tee-spin
Got a 6 o'clock cravin', stop, get Ciroc
It's 'bout to be an unbelievable night
I called it surreal, Sir Mix-a-Lot tape in
Hit the spot, spot my next victim
I'm picky like I missed a spot shavin'
Came to sip vodka, shit
Yeah, that little chick is hot but if she got rabies
I wouldn't give the bitch a shot, I'd poke her in the rear
But I bet if I licked her, she'd try to chase me (Ha-ha)
What are you: pit, rott, mixed?
Or you just got fixed, well, shit, then let's lip-lock
If not, then chicks, piss off, you snobby little pig snot nose
You think you're hot shit cause you're in heat
Well, bitch, if you're solar, then I'm your polar opposite, dog
Cause I'm colder than popsicle sticks, poppin' shit
Talkin' it, walkin' it, spit boxin'
My sick thoughts are 'bout to lick shots
Like this shit's hoppin'
And drip-droppin' in chocolatey whip-toppin'
So whether you're hip-hop, Slipknot, B. I. G. , Pac
Kid Rock, Kris Kross, Rick Ross, you'll dig this
If not, then kick rocks in flip flops
And I produced the track
So you don't have to ask who it is
When this shit knocks (Turn up!)
So bring clairvoyance to this bangin'
And I'm a keep on sayin'
All the shit I should be hung for
And probably killed for sayin'
And I probably will, but not until the day I pop a pill again
Like choppin' 'til I'm droppin'
Still if that don't do the job of killin' Shady
Then the karma will
They sayin' I must bring it as Mohammad
Until the Parkinson's done eat away my brain
And made me Robin Williams crazy
Or I end up with dementia, but you rockin' with a sadist
Hate to say this, but if the thought is entertainin'
I ain't stoppin' till we sprayed it
Oh my god, for real man, not again I'm shakin'
But before I tie a rope around this nob
If they don't like it, got a knob that they can slob on until
Wait, I just forgot what I was thinkin'
What's it called again? I'm blankin'
The thing above the balls between my legs
And I think I can feel it dangling
It's throbbing and it's veiny
Wait, I think I got it, okay, bitch I got you
Robin Williams hangin'
Go hang in the lobby unless you came to slob me
Come on kemosabe
It's past time, like your favorite hobby
Cause if the way that I spit shit remains on my dick
Then she grab me by the nuts
And tried to take my sausage as a hostage
Ain't it obvious? Pretty much a no brainer
Or should I say Cobainer?
That she's plain addicted to my dick like Lorena Bobbit
Gotta wean her off it, weiner off it
Like she took my fucking penis, chopped it
And stuck it up between her armpits
And she begun to swing a crumpet knife
And paint the carpet, at least
That's what her train of thought is
Cause I came, saw, conquered, hit it, quit it
And made up a plate of bonkers
And I always end up giving these bitches some complex
And I don't mean apartment
So spread your feet apart
And let me see you do some yoga stretches, splits
Now grab this Cuisinart
And make me breakfast, bitch, that's a prerequisite
And that's just to get in this bedroom, bitch
Walked up to that Ke$ha chick (what up?)
Said my name is Booger, wanna catch a flick?
I'll even let you pick, make her fetch a stick
Bet you if you get this old dog these new tricks
To get familiar with I'll learn extra quick
Kick a pregnant bitch, oops, I guess the shit
Took an unexpected twist
Like the neck of the freaking exorcist
Cha-cha-cha
Bitch, I said that this mask ain't for hockey
Hate Versace, Versace, I got Münchhausen by proxy
I'm making you sick, don't pretend you can't hear me
You deaf, girl, I said you was foxy
I'll tell a bitch like Bizarre
Bitch, shut the fuck up and get in my car
And suck my fucking dick while I take a shit
And I think with my dick so come blow my mind
And it tastes like humble pie
So swallow my pride, you're lucky just to follow my ride
If I let you run alongside the Humvee
Unless you're Nicki, grab you by the wrist, let's ski
So what's it gon' be? Put that shit away Iggy
You gon' blow that rape whistle on me
(Squee!) I love it
'Fore I get lost with the gettin' off
Like this is our exit, now lets hit the highway
And try not to get lost

Til we get to Las Vegas

Whatever happens in my room
It stays in my room like movie night like cable
Treat every women in my stable like flavors
Looking like she kryptonite and I get weak after like 7 days
In 7 nights in the Days Inn, it's Hot Vegas
We roll in circles and packs, we the lifesavers
She got a boyfriend, I got a toy then
I'll bring it with me when I show up to her crib waving
And I ain't tryna meet a nice neighbor
I'm so Jay Electronic, I'm cut like I'm all out of razors
And all I got is a gun left with a bayonet on it
Neck so frozen it look like I walked in a jewelry store
With a about a million dollars with your mama
And sat down did an ALS challenge, haan
I stole that adlib from French, Bad & Evil back at it again
About to get my back tatted again
About to get a pic of a backstabber with an axe in his hand
Sitting on a bike in the sand
If you ain't been through nothing
Then that shouldn't mean nothing to you
Like likes on the Gram
If she current I keep her pussy
Purring like the pipes on a Lamb
Weed got her so chinky eyed
Look like she been getting high on a flight to Japan
I keep my jewelry on while I'm fucking
Sound like I'm shaking up dice in a can
Listen, though this ain't Christmas I make you my ex miss
If this is my passion
I learn to give those who don't appreciate my presence
The gift of my absence
I don't know who you been listening to
Got me fucked up like Pookie in the chicken coop
Bitch, I don't give a two shits
Bitch, get the fuck out of my face
To make a long story short, I don't really gotta stand there
And listen to you while you throw a silly tantrum
Even though I have an affinity for a witty banter
Starting to feel like foulplay like Billy Laimbeer
Hold up, she misunderstood me
I said saint, por favor
Thought I said the Wraith had four doors
I knock a nigga face off
Give him the bottom of the nine
Like a baseball scoreboard (whatever...)
I leave the club with my tab still open
Won't even get a cab for you and your friend
The only fear I have is of loathing
And I won't even kick in 'till we get to Las Vegas

Ya'll ready, ya'll ready, y'all ready know, Slaughterhouse
[Joell Ortiz]
Little niggas get your weight up fuck y'all, pay up
My bars just as slick as my dick and both stay up
Nicer than me, say what? Wait up, straight up
I finish niggas right off the bat like a layup
I seen a lot of come, I seen a lot of go
But y'all know where I'm from, B-R double O
You know the rest pimpin', yeah, I was bred different
Here come pops with the NY bop, you know, the leg limpin'
My ice mug frozen till it's stiff
Grimy nigga, might wanna hold onto your bitch
I got a way with women, I faithfully play with women
Let 'em suck on this bottle and pray that I throw a baby in 'em
I might just throw on my gold fronts
Pour up a cup of E & J and light up a dro blunt
I was never soft, never saw me flinchin' when they lettin' off
Never had to retaliate cause I set it off
Ya'll ready, ya'll ready, y'all ready know, Slaughterhouse
[Royce Da 5'9]
Ya'll know my name, bitch, never change up my language
I'm just a rich nigga from a city that's bankrupt
First we take oath, then I'm pulling turquoise strings
In my Lebron corks, in Turks and Caicos
I came from wicker chair fame wearin' short sets
I learned that money can't buy happiness
But I decided I'd rather do all my cryin' in the Corvette
Make a dollar, buy a suit
Have a child, and have 'em follow suit
Wavin' that weather change thing
Make the winter fall, coming through with everything to lose
Taking everything from you know
Let him finish his fall in his draws
And pray that he land on that minute hand in my Hublot
I'm about that Art Of War gospel
That Basquiat Picasso drawing a roscoe
Using the blood of a usual thug who was told die slow
Your money on me, bet it all, you know I'mma set it off
Ya'll ready, ya'll ready, y'all ready know, Slaughterhouse
[Joe Budden]
Let's skip the small talk and get right to the wealth
Truth is I give a fuck, but it's right to myself
Fuck fame, keep the shit I write to myself
If what I do is therapeutic, man, the slightest shit helps
Made angel dust my freshman year
Gave it a try, cool, little did I knew
Had the wrong meaning of high school
Teachers called him a sociopath and a liar
Fuck them, only went to class for the cyphers
Now I'm gettin' bills for
The same thinking they tried to prescribe pills for
They said I needed a wrench, I'm a loose screw
Vital, suicidal, said I would kill me or more
Wasn't speakin' in French, said I'd let it off
Never know who or what you might get
Main reason they never want me to set it off
You now dealing with four niggas that's never off
All bets are off, so nah, you won't be better off
Ya'll ready, ya'll ready, y'all ready know, Slaughterhouse
[Crooked I]
Jewish tats on my arm like a Semitic boss
Egyptian ankh hanging, that's my Kemetic cross
Slaughterhouse set it off
Even got bitches wavin' our flag, Betsy Ross
Old school Chevy, the head is off
Decapitated Impala
Heavy 'lac from the weight of the llama
Still bear arms like a shaven koala
How you thinkin' like a faded neurology student
Is prudent when chasin' a dollar
So never mind, a clever rhyme
I'd rather find a better grind, forever times
Sittin' behind me because I'm ahead of mine
In this era I'm livin' outside of the paradigm
I'm comin' outside with a pair of dimes
Sharon and Caroline
Share a line then they share a 9 inch, never mind
I probably shouldn't even keep going
Cause these rappers keep hoein' with their teeth showing
I set it off
Ya'll ready, ya'll ready, y'all ready know, Slaughterhouse"
Guts Over Fear ,Shady XV,2014,"Feels like a close, it's coming to
Fuck am I gonna do?
It's too late to start over
This is the only thing I, thing I know
Sometimes I feel like all I ever do is
Find different ways to word the same old song
Ever since I came along
From the day the song called ""Hi! My Name Is"" dropped
Started thinking my name was fault
Cause anytime things went wrong
I was the one who they would blame it on
The media made me the equivalent
Of a modern-day Genghis Kahn
Tried to argue it was only entertainment, dawg
Gangsta? Naw, courageous balls
Had to change my style
They said I'm way too soft
And I sound like AZ and Nas, out came the claws
And the fangs been out since then
But up until the instant that I went against it
It was ingrained in me
That I wouldn't amount to a shitstain I thought
No wonder I had to unlearn everything
That my brain was taught
Do I really belong in this game? I pondered
I just wanna play my part, should I make waves or not?
So back and forth in my brain the tug of war wages on
And I don't wanna seem ungrateful or disrespect
The artform I was raised upon
But sometimes you gotta take a loss
And have people rub it in your face before
You get made pissed off
And keep pluggin' it's your only outlet
And your only outfit, so you know they gonna talk about it
Better find a way to counter it quick and make it, ah
Feel like I've already said this a kabillion eighty times
How many times can I say the same thing
Different ways that rhyme?
What I really wanna say is, is there anyone else
That can relate to my story?
Bet you feel the same way I felt
When I was in the same place you are
When I was afraid to
[Sia]
Afraid to make a single sound
Afraid I would never find a way out, out, out
Afraid I'd never be found
I don't wanna go another round
An angry man's power will shut you up
Trip wires fill this house with tiptoed love
Run out of excuses for everyone
So here I am and I will not run
Guts over fear, the time is near
Guts over fear, I shed a tear
For all the times I let you push me round
And let you keep me down, now I've got
Guts over fear, guts over fear
[Eminem]
Feels like a close, it's coming to
Fuck am I gonna do?
It's too late to start over
This is the only thing I, thing I know
It's like I was there once, single parents
Hate your appearance
Did you struggle to find your place in this world?
And the pain spawns all the anger on
But it wasn't until I put the pain in songs
Learned who to aim it on
That I made a spark, started to spit hard as shit
Learned how to harness it
While the reins were off
And there was a lot of bizarre shit, but the crazy part
Was soon as I stopped saying ""I gave a fuck""
Haters started to appreciate my art
And it just breaks my heart
To look at all the pain I've caused
But what am I gonna do when the rage is gone?
The lights go out in the trailer park
And the window that was closing
And there's nowhere else I can go with flows in
And I'm frozen
Cause there's no more emotion for me to pull from
Just a bunch of playful songs
That I made for fun
So to the break of dawn here
I go recycling the same old song
But I'd rather make"" Not Afraid 2""
Than another mothafuckin' ""We Made You"" uh
Now I don't wanna seem indulgent
When I discuss my lows and my highs
My demise and my uprise, pray to God
I just opened enough eyes later on
Gave you the supplies and the tools
To hopefully use it to make you strong
Enough to lift yourself up when you feel like I felt
Cause I can't explain to y'all
How dang exhausted my legs felt
Just having to balance my damn self
Those dang eggshells, I was made to walk
But thank you ma, cause that gave me the strength
To cause Shady-mania
So when they empty that stadium
At least I made it out of that house
And a found a place in this world when the day was done
So this is for every kid who all's they ever did
Was dreamt that one day they would just get accepted
I represent him or her, anyone similar
You are the reason I made this song
Everything you're scared to say
Don't be afraid to say no more
From this day on forward, just let them a-holes talk
Take it with a grain of salt and eat their fucking faces off
The legend of the angry blonde lives on through you
When I'm gone
And to think I was
[Sia]
Afraid to make a single sound
Afraid I would never find a way out, out, out
Afraid I'd never be found
I don't wanna go another round
An angry man's power will shut you up
Trip wires fill this house with tiptoed love
Run out of excuses for everyone
So here I am and I will not run
Guts over fear, the time is near
Guts over fear, I shed a tear
For all the times I let you push me round
And let you keep me down, now I've got
Guts over fear, guts over fear"

High class only means stoned in school
Joints rolled up bigger than pony stool
Smoke, stains on the roof of the old Regal's brown
So what I got spokes on this bitch, and?
The lift kicks like climbin' into a spaceship
UFO's, unidentified flyin' Oldsmobiles
And mobile homes, amen
I can still smell the kerosene leakin'
I should've seen the signs, I was blowin' up
Either in a trailer home or a pickup
Hey, Bubba, your baby boy is in big trouble
I fuckin' ran through a briar patch and got cut up
Now I'm wide open in front of the whole town
I bled for the game, I guess it's obvious now
I'm goin' down now, he told me wear it with pride
You wanna take the hard road you gotta cherish the ride

Can't build a legacy up, then let it perish and die"

Not at all amazed at these haters, you? ve seen my catalog
Speaking and we keep flying over 'em like a cannonball
Think I? m this comical, swag follower just rhyming over beats
While these leakers suckin' all of us off (hell no)
Still got your mama covered in vomit in my cellphone
Y'all really got me fucked up
What you mixin' up in that cup?
What the hell you sprinkle in that blunt?
44, make him sober up
[Bizarre]
I got an addiction to all these prescriptions
Need an intervention, someone to listen
Catholic or Christian, fuck your suspicions
(Bitch! Gimme my molly and stop bitchin'!)
Turn it up (turn it down)
I be blowing on half a pound
Pass it around and pass it around
Merry go-round, merry go-round
She say she love me, but this bitch is ugly
(Shit, you ain't even know it)
I'mma still let her fuck me
The devil out to get me, moving pretty fast
Head on collision, I'm tryna avoid the crash (pain)
I'm running from my past (Bane)
That's why I wear the mask
These blood sucking leeches, all they want is the cash
You don't get the picture, it could be gone in a flash (pain)
I'm running from my past (Bane)
That's why I wear the mask
[Kuniva]
They say the devil is a liar
Nigga don't worry 'bout that loud mouth
Bumping his gums and babbling
Watch for them quiet niggas
On the real, you should come ride with us
Crew full of riders; Optimus
My bad cause it seems like you got your facts all crossed up, no Swastikas
Fadin' in and out of my consciousness
Tryna fight this feeling I? m conjurin'
That's why I wear a hat so low with a mask
Really feelin' like the Loch Ness
No bullshit, these bitches are more grimy
Doing a nigga real slimey
Had my little homie stretched out, death untimely
Need not remind me, hold up
Yo, don? t get doped up
Heard rumors that niggas wanna clap at me
Well actually, I was just over there
Niggas ain? t really do jack to me
That? s why I keep this mask on, straight face
Only thing that? s missing is my sherlon, get my Runyon Ave on
The devil out to get me, moving pretty fast
Head on collision, I'm tryna avoid the crash (pain)
I'm running from my past (Bane)
That's why I wear the mask

Fine Line,Shady XV,2014,"[Verse 1]
Another day, another hotel, the inside of it's nice though
Oh well, this is my life so
As I go and try to close for the nights show
See how far that line goes
Still blows my mind show
Business I'll never get some of this shit just always gives a weird
To this day cause all I ever did
Was just say the shit I'm the one that wanted to hear
Other people say to me when I was a kid
Son please don't make me some type of hero
Cause I will say some inspirational shit in a real way
But will still have a field day with some of the
Fucked up shit in the world and tell it to suck the dick
Cause I still make fun of a situation
Someone's in like a son of a bitch
At anothers expense, I'm fuckin' relentless
As fuck when it comes to this pen
I struggle with coming to my senses
Stuck on the fence on a balance beam if I seem unbalanced
It's challenging but my conscience allows me to think
The most foulish childish things without even blinking
Without even thinkin' about, all the stinkin' amounts of people that seem to be reachin' in the crowds
I'm scream in the palace, sold out this evening
But now it's, maybe down to sleeping
Is it really my soul to keep or
Have I sold it cheap is it greed
Do I take more than I need
When I joke about leavin'
But keep over achievin'
Because whats stolen from me barely broke even
[Hook]
It's a fine, fine line
It's a fine, fine line
[Verse 2]
So I notice how I paint myself
And through my hair when ordeals I'm so vain
I want my respect but ignore the
Butterfly effect that comes from my dialect
Till I, sit in the dark and I reflect
And my reflection shows what it's like here
Cause this vanity, surrounded by all these lights yeah
It's like a nightmare
I said, this vanity surrounded by these lights is a nightmare
And I don't like how I see myself so I
Open the Bible to Isaiah cause
I swear to Christ there are nights where
I stay up at night just to say a prayer twice
Just to make sure God hears cause this ice layer
Ice skate on tonights where
Put in it but I like stands
Feistier then a triceritops and like a dice player
I got a nice pair of dice here
Sealed off in my lair
Away from the bullshit good safe place to sit and talk shit
From this house it's quite big, but it ain't when you can't leave it
And I feel so isolated, nice I made it
But it's like I payed the price of fame twice I hate it
So I bitch about my life then make another song, it's a cycle ain't it
Then I wonder why I'm still famous
Keep walkin' the line
This gold fish poke it's old
But especially when you don't know
If your conscience is sayin' I told you so
You don't even know anymore if you got the soul of a soldier
Or if you sold your soul
[Hook]
[Bridge]
And from here you look so small
Hovering high above us all
Please come back, to me
[Verse 3]
I still remember the times when
They were simpler than the rhymes of
Vanilla Ice were when I was just killin' the mics
I'll never forget what that feeling was like
God, I miss those times now when I was just starting out
Without a diamond, now I'm diamond
I can't even stage dive in the crowd anymore now when I've been
Stuck in this house hibernate
Hate even going outside it
Sucks, sometimes I just wanna walk in Target and look at shit Browse, I don't even want to buy nothin'
I just wanna fuckin' walk around inside it
Look how excited, I sound when I get to talkin' bout life and
Everything about it I miss
Which now reminds me
Put a thousand lighters in the sky for the Outsidaz
Wow, I must have had Alzheimers
Long time since I shouted them out, bout time
Cause it's been on my mind lately how
Zee you always supported me
You vouched, I will never forget that and
How you guys, accepted me for me and Pace
I love you too, you slept on my couch
And I been thinkin' bout the time I slept on the floor at the outhouse
Rhyming is all we ever wanted to do
And regardless how life has turned out
Inside I'll always be an outsider
My life has been turned inside out but I"
Twitsted ,Shady XV,2014,"[Skylar Grey]
You sit there stone-faced, as if I'm not here
Can't you see that I've been crying?
I didn't know you'd be insane
Dreams can be so deceiving
You're an itch I can't reach
A wound that won't heal
The smell of skin that's burning
I didn't know you'd be insane
But it's true, and just say all I am to you
[Eminem]
Is a pain in my neck, thorn in my side
Stain on my blade, blood on my knife
Been dreaming of her, all of my life
But she won't come true, she's just my nightmare I woke up to
[Skylar Grey]
She's twisted, he's a lover, she's set, he's hard to handle
The worst part of all is he just don't care
She's twisted like a rope, that is wrapped around his throat
But the worst part of all is she really don't give a
(She don't give a shit)
[Skylar Grey and Eminem]
Sometimes I wish that you'd just die
Cause I'm too afraid of leaving
I didn't know you'd be insane
Dreams can be so deceiving
(How did it come to this?
Why do I fantasize to kill you when you're sleeping?)
I didn't know you feel the same
When I say you're no good
All you are to me

Love ain't no fairytale, love is a buried nail
Inside of this heart of stone, so you wanna get married? Well
Romeo, Romeo, smokin' blow with Antonio
In the back alley takin' shots of whiskey and only gold
Juliet's at the nudie bar, doin' God only knows
Neither one of 'em came to see the dog and the pony show
But a bitch is a bitch, and a horse is a horse
And I'm sorry I can't afford to get your daddy's old Porsche painted
Sorry Juliet that you embedded the sayin'
If a dollar makes you holler then I'm gettin' the short change of it
Feel like I've been asleepin' alone and lovin' this angel
Tangled between a dream and a coma
Walkin' the edge of this cliff, like a sheep to it's owner
Then wake up to this fuckin' bitch with an evil persona
Now if you say that you hate somebody and you livin' with them
Then they pack up and leave and then you bitch about how you miss 'em
You gotta see the pattern of the blood all over the steerin' wheel
Love is a cannibal ridin' a carnival carousel
'Round and 'round we roll, where it stops, baby nobody knows
Some people go crazy and they lose control
Some people jump off, some people won't let go
Some people say love, some people say why
Some people don't love, they just want a free ride
The rain won't stop, it'll never dry
If she's in the house of pain then love is standin' outside

She's twisted, he's a lover, she's set, he's hard to handle

So I guess this means Goodbye, for now"
Right For Me,Shady XV,2014,"I feel phenomenal as usual
Pharmaceuticals, glue sniff and pools of vomit at Bonnaroo
But I don't know if I'm in Tennessee, Chicago, or Houston
In the corner trying to seek solitude
Shallow but such a hollow dude
I won't even swallow solid food
Alcoholic too, plus I'm on lean like the Tower of Pisa
Top it off I'm on mushrooms so fuck all of you
Roses are violet, mollies are blue
Lost in a ball of confusion
Its all an illusion
It's probably the shrooms I'm on
Cause I think I started hallucinating
Cause I just thought I just heard Jay Electronica
And Odd Future's new shit
And all I can do is follow the music
And end up with Paula Abdul at Lollapalooza
Fillin' water balloons with nail polish remover
Just to pop 'em and wallow in fumes
I feel uptight I gotta get looser
After I finish polishing off this bottle of booze I got a solution
Concentrated like orange juice so I'm not as diluted
Cause all this delusion got me seein' shit
Excusez-moi but that coochie that passed
You see her ass? Wouldn't make her my main squeeze
But juicier ass, it belongs in a juicer
It's mouth waterin' too so I walked up to it like I'm Marshall
Wanna try to meet my standards? I'll Introduce ya
Oh I'm a misogynist too but I'm not a masseuse
But my attitude is rubbin' off on the youth
A chronic abuser, not only user of marijuana
I mean verbal assault that I use to smoke all of you losers
Got a bazooka, a shotgun, a ruger, a Glock, and a nuke
And a Rottweiler too, and I'm not in the mood so
When I say I'm bringing the TEC out
I'm not coming to repair your fuckin' electronic computers
God, I'm gonna puke
I'm so gone off the hookah
I think I swallowed a loofah
I'm tore up, demolished, a fuckin' stone like Oliver
Like I looked Medusa in the eyeball to seduce her
The thoughts I produce are loony tunes
The box of usable latex gloves
And the socks and the shoes
To replace next up Veronica's boobs
And uhh, paycheck stubs that were stuffed in the glove box
In a blue Honda with used condoms were clues
The girl was just not the one suitable for or
Right for me, will change me, rearrange my head to be
Just right for you and me, don't laugh, please listen
Don't laugh, please listen
Thought I'd give in to the pressure
Collapse and crumble perhaps
Relapsing under that
Well that's a bunch of crap
In the clutch, I'm the Captain Crunch of rap
And I'm sick of acting humble, that's enough of that
Fuck that shit, cut the sack
Like its a natural reaction
That's why I'm actually trapped in this shoving match
Cause push keeps coming to that
I can keep getting my ass kicked, I? m coming back
Like a sarcastic crumpled sack of shit, still mad
Disgruntled had some struggles yeah
But that passionate hunger's back
The fantastic juggling act
And the way I flip my tongue on the track
It's like verbal acrobatics
But in fact
Last time I tried to pull off a dramatic stunt as drastic
I fuckin' crashed my hovercraft
After I strapped the duffel bag to my back
And stuck the massive punchin' bag in it
An elastic bungee strap, proper plaster, a thumb tack
And a piece of plastic bubble wrap
Went spastic and fuckin' snapped
Jumped and splashed in a puddle of battery acid
Stumbled back, recovered, back flipped
And landed on a gymnastic tumble mat
And for my last trick, lunge on back lash
On a NASA shuttle flap, fuckin' snapped the rudder in half
Chuckled and laughed, buttaled my last rebuttal
And just asked him to come crash
And I grab my Go-Go-Gadget inflatable gigantic
Humongous mattress
And ceramic construction hat
Rubbed my magic mushroom tat
Fell off then splat, get up from that
Face taped to a waste paper basket
Throw up then gas, lungs collapse
And that's more likely than finding someone that's
Right for me, will change me, rearrange my head to be
Just right for you and me, don't laugh, please listen
Don't laugh, please listen
Couple of shots of Jäger
Public intoxication, dis-fuckin'-combobulation
Flooded with thoughts of anger
While I was away I know probably some of you got to thinkin'
""You're top ten ain't cha?
""stop cause you fuckers are talkin' crazy
And stop interrupting you're not even up in the conversation
Whether you're punchin' a clock or famous
Underground, pop, or nameless, whatever your job is
I came to fuck with your occupation
You're thinkin' just cause you came in with scrubs
And you brought the scalpel and sponge
The oxygen tank and the suction
And shot the brain surgeon
Stuck in the operating room
Once you done swapped your name with him
Smuggled in Ronald Reagan
Dug him up; Donald Fagen
While juggling waffles baking
Fuckin' McDonalds egg and cheese sausage bagel finagle
They flung it across the table
Then bump it and knock it shake it
Jumped and got in the way then disrupted my concentration
I said fuck it and lost my patience
They all woke up from sedation
Ain't none of you Doctor Dre
So then what does it got you thinkin'
You can fuck with this operation
Aftermath, still running hip-hop amazing
I'm still pluggin' along
No need for an assumption
Here's confirmation
I'm up for the long duration
I'm just looking for something to walk away with
Some pocket change and a little integrity
Though I'll probably be jumpin' across the stage
Till I'm fuckin' Madonna's age and
Stuck in an awkward place in my life
But I shit you not like I'm plugged up with constipation
That day will come before
I finally stumble upon some lady that's
Right for me, will change me, rearrange my head to be
Just right for you and me, don't laugh, please listen
Don't laugh, please listen"
Detroit Vs. Everybody ,Shady XV,2014,"Tell 'em if they want it, they can come get that static

Detroit vs. Everybody
[Royce Da 5'9""]
I took a bite out the rotten apple by the poison tree
All these females need to e-mail to make noise
And I think things changin' a lot, he fuck with my authority
Then he shall see shells, but not by the seashore
If he gangbangin' or not
It's simple as the alphabet
He F with me, that G shall surely see
He definitely is 'bout it, it's retail fraud, he's weak
The honest gesture
The trigger finger 'round the diamond tester
We tail flaw with heat
The same soldier, it's me, myself and I
Ridin' 'round shootin' my biopic and my autobiography
Range Rover, this ain't the squash beef state
You thinkin' makeup, we thinkin' Lark Voorhies face
This twin Eagle's an Aries coupe
Might as well ride by in an ambulance
My parachute like skydivin' in Hammer pants
So call it siblin' rivalry
Take his life, call it the unforgivable robbery
A wise man told me that holdin' a grudge is like
Lettin' somebody just live inside your head rent free
Real talk, I don't got time to evict these clowns
Y'all niggas been bitches, that's none of my business
But I don't sip tea
(That's Nickel) ride around his block
All he knows is pitfalls
That's why he's always climbin' out his drop
(I got a question) do you wanna ride or die?
Welcome to Detroit, mothafucka
[Big Sean]
Boy, I need no halves and halves, I want the game in entirety
100 percent cut, no stitches required
Welcome to Detroit, where, if you get that promotion
Don't worry, man them bullets will still be at your ass firin'
I still call it safe, I would suck if I was umpirin'
Boy, I hit the beat, I just treat that shit like a diary
I'm offended if you hear my new shit
And you ain't rewindin' me
Self made, I never needed your bail or a wire, see
Never callin' collect, I call to collect
My homie wanted a Chevy so I put my dawg in the vet
Plus I'm so loyal that that paper, boy, is all that I fetch
Got the ball in my hand and the ball in the net
Bitch, I'm the D, can't no offense dunk on me
I'm Mr. Big Shot, these hoes get drunk off me
I'm overrespected
My mama's gated community's overprotected
So futuristic, I'm already over my next bitch
Reminiscin' on listenin' to 50 50 times a day
Back when 10th grade was like 50 days away
Tryna get paid 50 ways a day
Used to put 50 on the layaway
Now my closet 50 shades of grey
26 and I've done lived a lifetime a few times
From futons to Grey Poupons
In church tryna get a little savings, yeah, coupons
I spit that A1 every day, I'm hittin' new primes
Now the stakes high, niggas surprised at the new lines
Or takin' down my number like ""you still ain't got a new line? ""
Nah it's the same, we've been laborin' for years
I know it took longer than 9 months
But fuck it, it's all in due time
I turned a blunt to a roach
With dreams of bein' a Beatle though
One, two I need to, gotta learn to keep it cerebral
When you come up in a place
Where everyone got a piece but ain't peaceful
This is just part 1, wait 'til the sequel

Comin' from them streets where they thirsty, starvin' to eat
Just a step away from felon, that's why they call it the D
On your bleeder, ho, reason for all of this honesty
Honestly no honor roll, but honor the Phantom stripper pole
'Cause I'm a Lynwood nigga, them young niggas say
Put a sack on your head
You bleed a lake on a Grand River
And to think our hood harder, then I might break the door
Know some killers pull the trigger for a Swisher and Molly
In a blink I'll hit your kisser, bet you ass ain't rememberin'
They say my city's tougher than two fat bitches scissoring
So nigga I'm a veteran, retire my letterman
Had K's in front ya school
But I ain't going to Kettering
Cough up a line, 313 where I'm from
Zan got me cross eyed like Bernstein's son
And these niggas try to copy but I hold on this time
It's us vs them, Detroit vs Everybody
[Eminem]
Lately it seems as if it's me against the world
Like it was before my life became a movie
And they usually use my mothafuckin' trailer to tease me with
But I flip that script like AB filler
Painkillers to pop that lid off that safety seal
It made me feel amazing, made me celebrate free
And if I may reiterate, I ain't even need a script
I ain't bein' conceited
But I made it to radio, eat a dick
I still never ABC the shit
Mainstream appeal and the skill is what made me iller
Since before they called Jay Dee Dilla
I was daydreamin' one day that I would be the shit
And if I ever end up escapin' the streets
I swear that I would stay here
Still in it, I'm crazy, I'll always be real
Don't make me steal an 18 wheeler
Break all of my friends out of here
And take 'em straight to the Mercedes dealer
Peel off back to the same block that we came from, rampage
You crazy for me to flip
What's makin' you think I need a switch?
'Cause I'm Adrian Peterson
When he's raging and heated
And on the way to go beat his kid
On the track I spank like he just did
(DETROIT!) I can't never leave this bitch
Sick of bein' treated like me and shit
Jesus, I can see why people stop callin' me to do features
And them cyphers on BET
'Cause if I wasn't me
I probably wouldn't want to play with me neither, shit
Seems to be reachin' this fever pitch
180 degrees in here
Trying to wait for the cedar chips
MCs bit off more than they can chew
Like a face full of Swedish Fish
Or Lorena with two penises
Hateful and genius, this inconvenience
And for the record, you won't want
This kind of static in your life
When I'm makin' you cling to it
They consider tryna reinsulate yah
When it's maybe in for another crazy winter
It's so cold in the D, it is as days begin to tick away
But ain't this what really made me into the angry bitter blonde
Sick of bein' underdog
Don't make me unleash this shit, release this Pit
May even seem as if
I'm yankin' your chain a bit or maybe the way I'm sayin' shit
Is playin' with your relation, changin' it
It's still the same and Shady's still a lady killer
Since the day I went insane and attacked the baby sitter
With a potato peeler and mushed her face
Into the entertainment center
It's like another plane just entered into Ukraine again
The Bermuda Triangle
And attempted to make a safety center
Awaiting anyone who ain't affiliated could be danger
Did you make arrangements with the gangsters
When you came here?
And I came to kill 'em

Tell 'em if they want it, they can come get that static
I swear I love my city, I just want a little static
See me, they salute me, they ain't ready for that static

What up, though, it's the godfather Trick Trick
You either ridin' with us or gettin' rolled on

Take it down to the hood
Let the little homies get this remix crackin'

Cool, calm, just like my mom
With a couple of law suits inside her palms

And 5 I hit
Ah shit
I started a mosh pit
Squashed a chick
And lost the foster kids
This room makes me hallucinate
Then I sweat till I start losing weight
Till I see dumb shit start happenin'
Dumber than Vanilla Ice tryin' to rap again
So bounce, bounce, c'mon bounce
I said c'mon bounce
Everybody in the house doin' mass amounts
To the women in the thongs with they asses out

He's upstairs wrestling with Elton John
Hey Von, you see me steppin' on these leprechauns?
It gotta be Tums the Ex-lax is gone
Yeah I took 'em all down with some parmesian
And I think my arm is gone
Yo, it's probably numb
Dumb dumb and fulla cum
And I think he 'bout to swallow his tongue
You scary ass it was a false alarm
You think I'm about to die when I just got on?
So stop acting stupid
You so high that you might wake up with a guy

I think I got the runs

Watch out HERE IT COMES!

Lose Yourself (Demo Original Version),Shady XV,2014,"Yo, if you could just, for one minute
Or one split second in time, forget everything
Everything that bothers you, or your problems
Everything, and follow me
If I was frozen inside of a moment
If I could capture time inside a capsule
An hourglass full of sand in the palm of my hand
It passes through it
If I can grasp it, and just control what happens to it
Then I can trap it
So no more time elapses through it
If raps could do it
Maybe I could tap into it
Then I could try to channel it through Cadillacs and Buicks
To transmit through 'em
To make you put your ass into it
And that's when you hit the roof
Because you can't sit through it
Your passions too much for you to not to be dancing to it
And as you do it
Your movements become fast and fluent
You're mashin' to it, moshing
Until you're black and bluish
And shit you're acting foolish
This music it has influenced you to be rowdy
But in an orderly fashion
True it's chaotic
But it's got your body moving as a unit
Uniting together tonight, so make it last and you better just
Lose yourself in this music
This moment we own it
We won't never let it go (go)
You better move yourself
Because tomorrow's ass can wait
There is no time, to sit there and procrastinate
You better lose yourself in this music
This moment we own it
We won't never let it go (go)
You better move yourself
Because tomorrow's ass can wait
There is no time, to sit there and procrastinate
You better
Cause when we descend together
We begin to move as one
In perfect unison just like the moon and sun
Illuminate the room
And humans soon become aluminum
Rhythmically in sync, if you'll excuse the pun
But if you close loose it once
I mean if you could let shit go
Relax, take a breath, and just let it exit slow
To rest your soul
You could leave the rest to me
If I could give the world a hit of ecstasy
To make 'em feel the feeling
I'm feeling right this minute
Cause I feel like the night won't end til I get finished
So close the shades
Makin' sure no light gets in it
The skies the limit tonight because the night's infinite
A high percentage
Of black people and white mixed in it
But no one really gives a fuck
Because they just like what's spinnin'
His life was spinnin', the whole entire night just spinnin'
Like life's beginning
So come out from inside your skin and quit hidin' in it
Lose yourself in this music
This moment we own it
We won't never let it go (go)
You better move yourself
Because tomorrow's ass can wait
There is no time, to sit there and procrastinate
You better lose yourself in this music
This moment we own it
We won't never let it go (go)
You better move yourself
Because tomorrow's ass can wait
There is no time, to sit there and procrastinate
You better"

Push the whip, see me rollin', you can tell that I'm holdin'

When me and Fif' got together to do this music
The more we became enveloped we just developed a fellowship through it
It's no pretend shit, it's friendship, me nemesis is su nemesis
Ain't for him, it's just media, see to them it's just images
But this shit is no gimmicks, this is blood in and blood out
When there's beef you just gotta know when to butt in and butt out
If there's a problem we solve it, if we don't resolve it
It usually just evolves into one big brawl and we all get involved in it
We should all get a merit, this much beef we inherit
And wear it like a badge of honor, pass it around and share it
And let it go to whoever's holdin' the most current people on their shoulders
And their soldiers got their backs till it's over
But tonight, we ain't comin' here to beef with nobody
We came to party, Banks, Ca$his and Mr. Ferrari
So it's Shady Aftermizat back in that ass, you wizzass
Come hizzon what kinda fuzukin' quizition is that

Who run it?

Pistol play ricochet, see where the victim lay
Slumped over bleeding J.F.K
Hays K to your chest plate cave
I ride to the death, do you rep that way?
Forever I'ma be a Shady 7-4 gangsta
Plus I survive everything you got in that chamber
I thrive off of danger, jumpin' in all beef
You keep talking shit now the squad called me
[Lloyd Banks]
Enough holdin' back the steam, Em let off a magazine
Dappadon Cappa queen mixed in with Cashis creams
Started off with half a dream, developed into what you see
Telling ain't my cup of tea, can't tell I'm a fuckin' G
I'm on automatic when I'm at it, start static
And you splattered, shit shattered, I'm a walkin' bitch magnet
Spit it how I live it, live it all the way to the limit
And I'm always on my pivot for my digits, you dig it?

So who run it?

My Band,Shady XV,2014,"[Eminem]
I don't know dude
I think everybody's all jealous and shit
'cause I'm like the lead singer of a band dude
And I think everybody's got a fuckin' problem with me dude
And they need to take it up with me after the show
Because...
CHORUS [Eminem]
These chicks don't even know the name of my band
But they're all on me like they wanna hold hands
'cause once I blow they know that I'll be the man
All because I'm the lead singer of my band
[Eminem]
So I get off stage right, drop the mic
Walk up to these hot chicks and I'm all like
""What's up ladies, my name's Slim Shady
I'm the lead singer in D-12 baby""
They're all like ""Oh my God it's him""
""Becky oh my fuckin' God it's Eminem""
""I swear to fuckin' God dude you fuckin' rock""
""Please won't you please let me suck your cock""
And by now the rest of the fellas get jealous
Especially when I drop the beat and do my acapellas
All the chicks start yellin', all the hot babes
Throw their bras and their shirts and the panties on stage
So like every single night they pick a fight with me
But when we fight it's kinda like siblin' rivalry
'cause they're back on stage the next night with me
""Dude I just think you're tryna steal the light from me""
Yesterday Kuniva tried to pull a knife on me
'cause I told him Jessica Alba's my wife to be
This rock star shit, it's the life for me
And all the other guys just despise me because
Chorus
My band (9x)
[Swifty]
You just wanna see a nigga backwards don't you?
Hey dad how come we don't rap on proto
Smash these vocals and do a performance
But we in the van and he in a tour bus
You don't want my autograph, you's a liar
And no I'm Swift (oh I thought you was Kuniva)
And what the hell is wrong with that dressing room
'cause my shit is lookin' smaller than a decimal
See I know how to rap, it's simple but
all I did was read a Russell Simmons book
So I'm more intact, tryna get on the map
Doin' jumpin' jacks while get whipped on my back
[Kuniva] Look him little punk ass thinkin' he the shit
[Kon Artis] Yeah I know man find himself takin' on a flick
[Kuniva] Hey I thought we had an interview with DJ Clue
[Eminem] No! I had an interview, not you two
[Kuniva] You gonna be late for soundcheck
[Kon Artis] Man I ain't goin' to soundcheck
[Kuniva] But our mics are screwed up
[Kon Artis] And his always sound best
You know what man I'ma say somethin'
[Kuniva] Aiyo Em (You got somethin' to say?!)
[Kon Artis] Man no
[Kuniva] I thought you 'bout to tell him off, man what's up
[Kon Artis] Man I'ma tell him when I feel like it, man shut up
And you ain't even back me up when we s'posed to be crew
[Kuniva] Man I was 'bout to talk right after you I swear, I swear man
Chorus
[Proof]
They say the lead singer's rock, but the group is not
Once we sold out arenas to the amusement parks
I'ma go let the world know that Proof is hot
I should cut his mic off when the music starts
Ready to snap on a dumbass fan
Every time I hear... (Hey dude I love your band!)
We ain't a band bitch we don't play instruments
So why he get 90 and we only get 10 percent
And these guys they can find every area code (Proof carry my bag)
Bitch carry your own
Can't make it to the stage, security in my way
(Who the fuck are you? Where's Obie and Dre?!)
[Bizarre]
God damn it I'm sick of this group
Time for me to go solo and make some loop
I told you I made the beats and wrote all the raps
Till Kon Artis, slipped me some crack
Lose Yourself video, I was in the back
Superman video, I was in the back
Fuck the media, I got some suggestions
Fuck Marshall, ask us a question
Like who's D-12, how we get started (But what about Eminem?)
Bitch, are you retarded?
Anyway I'm the popularest guy in the group
Big ass stomach, bitches think I'm cute (Hey sexy)
Then he told me to do sit-ups to get buff
I did two and a half and then I couldn't get up
Fuck D-12, I'm outta this band
I'm gonna start a group with the real Roxanne
[Eminem]
Girl why can't you see you're the only one for me
and it just tares my ass apart to know that you don't know my name
[Bizarre]
These chicks don't even know the name of my band (haha)
But they're all on me like they wanna hold hands (Fuck Marshall)
'cause once I blow I know that I'll be the man (yeah)
All because I'm the lead singer...
[Eminem] My band (9x)
[Bizarre] (In background)
The hottest boy band in the world
D12!
[Eminem] (as a salsa singer)
I'm the lead singer of my band
I get all the girl's to take off their underpants
And the lead singer of my band, my salsa
Makes all the pretty girl's want to dance
My salsa, look out for my next single, it's called ""My Salsa""
My salsa, salsa, salsa, salsa
My salsa makes all the pretty girls want to dance
And take off their underpants
My salsa makes all the pretty girls want to dance
And take off their underpants, my salsa
Where'd everybody go?"
Survival ,The Marshall Mathers LP 2,2013,"This is survival of the fittest
This is do or die
This is the winner takes it all
So take it all
Wasn't ready to being a millionaire
I was ill-prepared
I was prepared to be ill though, the skill was there
From the beginning, it wasn't 'bout the ends
It was 'bout busting raps
And standing for something, fuck an acronym
Cut the fucking act like you're happy
I'm fucking back again with another anthem
Why stop when it doesn't have to end?
It ain't over 'til I say it's over
Enough when I say enough
Throw me to them wolves and close the gate up
I'm afraid of what'll happen to them wolves
When the thought of being thrown into an alligator pit
I salivated it
Weight is up, hands up like it's 12 noon, nah, homie
Hold them bitches straighter up, up
Wave 'em 'til you dislocate a rotator cuff
Came up rough, came to ruffle feathers, nah, egos
I ain't deflate enough
Last chance to make this whole stadium erupt
This is survival of the fittest
This is do or die
This is the winner takes it all
So take it all
I can see the finish line with each line that I finish
I'm so close to my goals
I can almost pole vault
Over the goal post
And if I don't got enough in the tank
Maybe I can just siphon enough
To fill up this last can, man
Will I survive in this climate or what?
They said I was washed up
And got a blood bath
I'm not a rapper, I'm an adapter
I can adjust
Plus I can just walk up to a mic and just bust
So floor's open if you'd like to discuss
Top 5 in this mothafucka and if I don't make the cut
What? Like I give a fuck
I'mma light this bitch up like I'm driving a truck
To the side of a pump, 0 to 60 hop in and gun it
Like G-Unit without the hyphen, I'm hyping 'em up
And if there should ever come a time
Where my life's in a rut
And I look like I might just give up, eh you might've mistook
Me for bowing out I ain't taking a bow
I'm stabbing myself
With a fucking knife in the gut
While I'm wiping my butt!
Cause I just shitted on the mic, and like getting cut
I get excited at the sight of my blood
You're in a fight with a nut
Cause I'mma fight 'til I die or win
Biting the dust it'll just make me angrier, wait
Let me remind you of what got me this far
Picture me quitting
Now draw a circle around it and put a line through it, slut
It's survival of what?
This is survival of the fittest
This is do or die
This is the winner takes it all
So take it all
So take it all
So get your ideas, stack your ammo
But don't come unless you come to battle
I'm mad now jump in the saddle
This is it, it's what you eat, sleep, piss and shit
Live, breathe, your whole existence just consists of this
Refuse to quit, fuse is lit
Can't diffuse the wick
I don't do this music shit, I lose my shit
Ain't got shit to lose, it's the moment of truth
It's all I know how to do
As soon as I get thrown in the booth, I spit
But my respect is overdue
I'm showing you the flow no one do
Cause I don't own no diploma for school, I quit!
So there's nothing for me to fall back on
I know no other trades
So you'd better trade your fucking mics
In for some tool-box-es
Cause you'll never take my pride from me
It'll have to be pried from me
So pull out your pliers and your screwdri-vers
But I want you to doubt me
I don't want you to buh-lieve
Cause this is something that I must use to suc-ceed
And if you don't like me then fuck you!
Self es-teem must be fucking shooting through-the-roof
Cause trust me
My skin is too thick and bul-let proof to touch me
I can see why the fuck I disgust you
I must be a-llergic to failure
Cause everytime I come close to it
I just sneeze, I just go atchoo then achieve!
This is survival of the fittest
This is do or die
This is the winner takes it all
So take it all
So take it all"
Fight Music,Shady XV,2014,"[Chorus]:
Keep on going you just gotta fight it,
keep on going cause it's not too late,
you can't back down, you can't back down.
Keep on going you just gotta fight it,
keep on going cause it's never too late,
you can't back down, you can't back down.
[Eminem]:
If I could capture the rage of today's youth and bottle it
Crush the glass from my bare hands and swallow it
Then spit it back in the faces of you racists
and hypocrites who think the same shit but don't say shit
You Liberace's, Versace's, and you nazis
Watch me, cause you thinking you got me in this hot seat
You motherfuckers wanna JUDGE me cause you're NOT me
You'll never STOP me, I'm TOP speed as you POP me
I came to save these new generations of babies
from parents who failed to raise 'em cause they're lazy
To grow to praise me I'm makin 'em go crazy
That's how I got this whole nation to embrace me
And you fugazi if you think I'ma admit wrong
I cripple any hypocritic critic I'm sic'd on
And this song is for any kid who gets picked on
A sick song to retaliate to, and it's FIGHT MUSIC!
[Chorus]:
Keep on going you just gotta fight it,
keep on going cause it's not too late,
you can't back down, you can't back down.
Keep on going you just gotta fight it,
keep on going cause it's never too late,
you can't back down, you can't back down.
[T.I]:
They say out of sight is out of mind
And 9 times out of 10 me and out of pocket out of line
You do it big everybody that you out shined
Then your old lady fate talk about how he got fine
She say she trying to get away
He say about time
Right now we all thinking damn hope it not mine
But when its lights out for you and you locked down
ain't not telling whether or not your lady when and got down
With that nigga cross town cause he hot now
Ripping up your love letters, lifting up her night gown
Right now somebody baby moma gettin piped down
kids in the next room listening, ima pipe down
The thought hurt don't it
But maybe she strong enough
for ain't get that lonely cause you wasn't gone long enough
True
It's just a temporarily setback
It's on when I get back , Like yeaah
[Chorus]:
Keep on going you just gotta fight it,
keep on going cause it's not too late,
you can't back down, you can't back down.
Keep on going you just gotta fight it,
keep on going cause it's never too late,
you can't back down, you can't back down."
Bad Guy,The Marshall Mathers LP 2,2013,"It's like I'm in this dirt diggin' up old hurt
Tried everything to get my mind off you, it won't work
All it takes is one song on the radio yer, right back on it
Remindin' me all over again how you fuckin' just brushed me off and left me so burnt
Spent a lot of time tryin' to soul search
Maybe I needed to grow up a little first
Well looks like I hit a growth spurt
But I'm comin' for closure
Don't suppose an explanation I'm owed for
The way that you turned your back on me just
When I may have needed you most, oh, you thought it was over
You could just close the chapter
And go about your life like it was nothin'
You ruined mine, but you seem to be doin' fine
Well I've never recovered, but tonight 'betcha that whatch yer
'Bout to go through's tougher than anything I ever have suffered
Can't think of a, better way to define poetic justice
Can I hold grudges? Mind is sayin' ""let it go fuck this""
Heart is sayin' ""I will once I bury this bitch alive hide the shovel and then drive off in the sunset"" and...
I flee the scene, like it was my last ride
You see right through, oh, you had me pegged the first time
You can see the truth, but it's easier to justify
What's bad is good and I hate to be the bad guy
I just hate to be the bad guy
And to think I used to think you was the shit, bitch
To think it was you at one time I worshipped? Shit
Think you can hurt people and just keep getting' away with it?
Not this time you, better go and get sewing kit, bitch
Finish this stitch so you can reap what you sew, knit wit
Thought some time would pass and I'd forget it? Forget it
You left our family in shambles
And you expect me to just get over him? Pretend he never existed?
Maybe gone, but he's not forgotten
And don't think cause he's been out the pictures so long
That I've stopped the plottin' and still ain't comin' to git 'cha
You're wrong and that shit was rotten
And the way you played him's same shit you did to me, cold
Have you any idea the shit I've gone through?
Feelings I harbor, all this pent-up resentment I hold on to
Not once you call to ask me how I'm doing
Letters you don't respond to 'em
Fuck it, I'm coming to see you
And gee who better to talk to than you?
The cause of my problems
My life is garbage and I'm 'bout to take it out on you
Puff, then I'm gone
I flee the scene like it was my last ride
You see right through, oh, you had me pegged the first time
You can see the truth but it's easier to justify what's bad is good
And I hate to be the bad guy, I just hate to be the bad guy
I've been driving around your side of this town
Like 9 frickin' hours and 45 minutes now
Finally I found your new address, park in your drive
Feel like I've been waiting on this moment all of my life
And it's now arrived, and my mouth is full of saliva
My knife is out and I'm ducking on the side of your house
See, it's sad it came to this point
Such a disappointment I had to make this appointment to come and see ya
But ain't here for ya empathy, I don't need your apology
Or your friendship of sympathy, it's revenge that I seek
So I sneak vengefully and treat your bedroom window
Like I reach my full potential, I peeked
Continue to peep, still bent low
Then keep tapping the glass lightly then start to crescendo
Sneak all the way 'round to the back porch
Man, door handles unlocked, shouldn't be that easy to do this
You don't plan for intruders beforehand?
Surprised to see me? Cat got your tongue?
Gag, chloroform rag, dag almost hack up a lung
Like you picked an axe up and then swung
Stick to the core plan, dragged to the back of a trunk
By one of your fans, irony spectacular, huh?
Now who's a faggot, you punk?
And here's your bronco hat, you can have that shit back cause they suck
It's just me, you and the music now, Slim
I hope you hear it, we're in a car right now
Wait, here comes my favorite lyric
""I'm the bad guy who makes fun of people that die""
And hey, here's a sequel to my Mathers Lp
Just to try to get people to buy
How's this for publicity stunt? This should be fun
Last album now cause after this you'll be officially done
Eminem killed by m and m
Matthew Mitchell, bitch, I even have your initials
I initially was gonna bury you next to my brother, but fuck it
Since you're in love with your city so much
I figured, what the fuck, the best place you could be buried alive is right here
Two more exits, time is quite near
Hope we don't get stopped, no license I fear
That sirens I hear? Guess 90 on the freeway wasn't the brightest idea
As cops appear in my driver side mirror
(Oh, God, police! Ah!)
Hope Fox Trot gets an aerial shot of your burial plot, at least
New plan Stan
Slim, chauvinist pig drove in this big Lincoln town car
Well gotta go, almost at the bridge, haha big bro it's for you
Slim, this is for him and frank ocean, oh hope you can swim good
Now say you hate homos again
I also represent anyone on the receiving end of those jokes you offend
I'm the nightmare you fell asleep and woke up still in
I'm your karma closing in with each stroke of a pen
Perfect time to have some remorse to show for your sin
Nope, it's hopeless, I'm the denial that you're hopelessly in
When they say all of this is approaching its end
But you refuse to believe that it's over, here we go all over again
Back's to the wall, I'm stacking up all them odds
Toilets clogged, yeah 'cause I'm talking a lot of shit but I'm backing it all up
But in my head there's a voice in the back and it hollers
After the track is demolished
I am your lack of a conscience
I'm the ringing in your ears
I'm the polyps on the back of your tonsils
Eating your vocal chords after your concerts
I'm your time that's almost up that you haven't acknowledged
Grab for some water but I'm that pill that's too jagged to swallow
I'm the bullies you hate, that you became
With every faggot you slaughtered
Coming back on you, every woman you insult
Batter, with the double standard you have when it comes to your daughters
I represent everything you take for granted
'Cause marshall mathers the rapper's persona's half a façade
And Matthew and Stan's just symbolic, of you not knowing what you had until it's gone
'Cause after all the glitz and the glam, no more fans that are calling your name
Cameras are off
Sad, but it happens to all of them
I'm the hindsight to say I told you so
Foreshadows of all the things that are to follow
I'm the future that's here to show you what happens tomorrow
If you don't stop after they call you the
Biggest laughing stock of rap who can't call it quits
When it's time to walk away
I'm every guilt trip
The baggage you have
But as you gather up all your possessions
If there's anything you have left to say
Unless it makes an impact don't bother
So before you rest your case
Better make sure you're packing a wallop
So one last time, I'm back
Before it fades into black and it's all over
Behold the final chapter in a saga
Trying to recapture that lightning trapped in a bottle
Twice the magic that started it all
Tragic portrait of an artist tortured
Trapped in his own drawings
Tap into thoughts
Blacker and darker than anything imaginable
Here goes a wild stab in the dark
As we pick up where the last Mathers left off"
Parking Lot (Skit),The Marshall Mathers LP 2,2013,"(Skit)

*shot*
Thank you!

Go, go, go (what the f... uck?)
What the fuck are you doing?
Mothafucker bail on me? Fuck you!

Aw, you gotta be fucking kidding me
Are you fucking kidding me?
Shit!
Get off

Rhyme Or Reason,The Marshall Mathers LP 2,2013,"Yeah, yeah... yeah, yeah, yeah
(What's your name?) Marshall
(Who's your daddy?) I don't have one
My mother reproduced like a komodo dragon
And had me on the back of a motorcycle
Then crashed in the side of loco-motive with rap
I'm loco
It's like handing a psycho a loaded handgun
Michelangelo with a paint gun
In a tantrum
Bout to explode all over the canvas
Back with the Yoda of rap in a spasm
Your music usually has them
But waned for the game your enthusiasm it hasn't
Follow you must, Rick Rubin my little Padawan
A Jedi in training, colossal brain
And, thoughts are entertainin'
But docile and impossible to explain and, I'm also vain and
Probably find a way to complain
About a Picasso painting
Puke Skywalker, but sound like
Chewbacca when I talk
Full of such blind rage I need a seein' eye dog
Can't even find the page
I was writing this rhyme on
Oh it's on a rampage, couldn't see
What I wrote I write small
It says ever since I drove a '79 Lincoln with white walls
Had a fire in my heart
And a dire desire to aspire, to Die Hard
So as long as I'm on the clock
Punching this time card
Hip-hop ain't dying on my watch
But sometimes, when I'm sleepin'
She comes to me in my dreams
Is she taken, is she mine?
Don't got time, don't care, don't have two shits to give
Let me take you by the hand to, promise land
And threaten everyone
'Cause there's no rhyme or no reason for nothing
(What's your name?) Marshall
(Who's your daddy?) I don't know him, but I wonder
(Is he rich like me?) Ha
(Has he taken, any time
To show you what you need to live?)
No, if he had, he wouldn't have ended up
In these rhymes on my pad
I wouldn't be so mad, my attitude wouldn't be so bad
Yeah Dad
I'm the epitome and the prime example of what happens
When the power of the rhyme falls into the wrong hands
And makes you want to get up
And start dancin', even if it is Charles Manson
Who just happens, to be rapping, blue lights flashing
Laughing all the way to the bank
Lamping in my K-Mart mansion
I'm in the style department
With a pile in my cart, ripping the aisle apart with
Great power comes absolutely no responsibility, for content
Completely, despondent and condescending
The king of nonsense
And controversy is on a, beat killing spree
Your honor, I must plead guilty
'Cause I sparked a, revolution, rebel without a cause
Who caused the evolution of rap
To take it to the next level, boost it
But several rebuked it, and whoever produced it
(Hip-hop is the devil's music) Is that me
It belongs to me?
Cause I just happen to be
A White honky devil with two horns
That don't honk but every time I speak you, hear a beep
But lyrically I never hear a peep, not even a whisper
Rappers better stay clear of me, bitch, cause it's the
It's the time of the season, when hate runs high
And this time, give it to you easy
When I take back what's mine with pleasured hands
And torture everyone, that is my plan
My job here isn't done
Cause there's no rhyme or no reason for nothing
(What's your name?) Shady
(Who's your daddy?) I don't give a fuck, but I wonder
(Is he rich like me?) Doubt it, ha
(Has he taken, any time, to show you what you need to live?)
So yeah, Dad let's walk, let's have us a father and son talk
But I bet we probably wouldn't get one block
Without me knockin' your block off
This is all your fault
Maybe that's why I'm so bananas
I appeal to all those walks of life
Whoever had strife
Maybe that's what dad and son talks are like
Cause I, related to the struggles of young America
When their fucking parents were unaware of their troubles
Now they're ripping out their fucking hair again
It's hysterical
I chuckle, 'cause everybody
Bloodies their bare knuckles, yeah uh-oh
Better beware knuckleheads
The sign of my hustle says don't knock
The doors broken, it won't lock
It might just fly open, get cold cocked
You critics come to pay me a visit
Misery loves company, please stay a minute
Kryptonite to a hypocrite
Zip your lip if you dish it but can't take it
Too busy getting stoned in your glass house to kick rocks
Then you wonder why I lash out
Mister Mathers as advertised on the flyers
So spread the word
'Cause I'm promoting my passion til I'm passed out
Completely brain dead Rainman
Going a bankhead in a restraint chair
So bitch, if you shoot me a look it better be a blank stare
Or get shanked in the pancreas
I'm angrier than all eight other reindeer
Put together with Chief Keef
Cause I hate every fucking thing, yeah
Even this rhyme, bitch
And quit tryna look for a fuckin' reason for it that ain't there
But I still am a CRIMINAL
Ten-year-old degenerate grabbing on my GENITALS
The last Mathers LP that went diamond
This time I'm predicting this one will go EMERALD
When will the madness end
How can it when there's no method to the pad and pen
The only message that I have to send is
Dad, I'm back at it again, yeah"
So Much Better,The Marshall Mathers LP 2,2013,"[verse 1]
Pick up the god dang phone
Bitch where the fuck were you tuesday?
With who you say?
I wasn't at the studio
Bitch what'd you do screw dre?
You went there looking for me
Oo that excuse is too lame
Keep playing me you're gonna end up
With a huge goose egg
You fake, lying slut you never told me you knew drake
Que lupe? you want to lose two legs
You try to flip this on me?
If I spent more time with you, you say
""ok yeeah, I'm cuckoo, hey? "" well, screw you
And I'd be the third person who screwed you today
Oh, four? dre, drake, lupe? oh touche
You were too two-faced for me
Thought you was my number one
True blueace but you ain't
And I can see you and you make
That little boo-boo face
Cause I'm hanging up this phone, boo
You make my fucking bluetooth ache
You feeling blue too late
Go smurf yourself you make me wanna smurfin' puke
Blue kool aid
Here's what you say to someone you hate
[hook]
My life will be so much better if you dropped dead (dead)
I was laying in bed last night thinking
And this thought just popped in my head and I thought
Wouldn't shit just be a lot easier if you dropped dead (dead)
I would feel so (so) much (much) better x3
[verse 2]
Think I just relapsed, this bitch pushed me over the brink
Hop on the freeway trying to get some time alone
And just think
Then the cops pulled me over but they let me go
Cause I told 'em I'm only driving drunk
Cause that bitch drove me to drink
I'm back on my fuck ho's
But a whole new hatred for blondes, but bias?
I hate all bitches the same, baby come on
Excuse the pun but bitch you're such a broad statement
And I am channeling my anger
Through every single station it's on
Cause a woman broke my he-art
I say he-art cause you ripped it in two pa-arts
And threw it in the garbage, who do you think you are?
Bitch guess it's time for me to get the dust off
And pick myself up off the carpet
But I'll never say the l-word again
I la-la-la-la lesbian *shout*
I hope you hear this song and go into a cardiac arrest
My life would be so much better if you just
[hook]
My life will be so much better if you dropped dead (dead)
I was laying in bed last night thinking
And this thought just popped in my head and I thought
Wouldn't shit just be a lot easier if you dropped dead (dead)
I would feel so (so) much (much) better x3
[bridge]
Cuz you told me, you love me, forever
Bitch, that was a lie
Now I never, wanted someone, to die
So bad in my fucking life but fuck it
There's other fish in the sea
[verse 3]
And I'mma have a whale of a time
Being a single sailor for the night
Bitch on a scale of 1 to 10, shit
I must be the holy grail of catches
Ho, I got an oscar attached to my fucking name (great)
I might hit the club, find a chick that's tailor made for me
Say fuck it kick some shots back
Get hammered and nail her
These bitches tryna get attached but they're failing
To latch onto the tail of my bumper
To scratch them with the back of my trailer
Like I'm itchin' to get hitched
Yeah I'm rich as a bitch but bitches ain't shit
I'd rather leave a bitch in a ditch
Bitch you complain when you listen to this
But you still throw yourself at me
That's what I call pitchin' a bitch
That's why I'm swinging at this chicks on sight
Long as I got a bat and two balls it's foul
But my dick's on strike so all that love shit is null and void
Bitch I'm a droid, I void cupid stupid
Wasn't for blowjobs you'd be unemployed
Oi oi oi, man oh man, you boy boy boys
Getting sick of these girls girls girls
Oink oink oink you fucking pigs
All you good boys doink doink doink
I got 99 problems and the bitch ain't one
She's all 99 of them I need a machine gun
I take em all out I hope you hear this song
And go into a cardiac arrest, have a heart attack
And just drop dead and I'mma throw a fucking party
After this cause
[hook]
My life will be so much better if you dropped dead (dead)
I was laying in bed last night thinking
And this thought just popped in my head and I thought
Wouldn't shit just be a lot easier if you dropped dead (dead)
I would feel so (so) much (much) better x3

I'm just playing bitch, you know I love you"

Tell me where to go, tell me what to do
I'll be right there for you
Tell me what to say, don't matter if it's true
I'll say it all for you
[Verse 1: Eminem]
I used to be the type of kid
would always think the sky is falling
Why am I so differently wired? Am I a martian?
What kind of twisted experiment am I involved in
Because I belong in this world
That's why scoffering authority, defined often
Flying off [...] to handle it with mom, no dad
So I'm non complying at home, at school
I'm just shy and awkward
And no I don't need no goddamn psychologist
Trynna diagnose why I have all these underlying problems
Thinking he can try and solve them
I'm outside chalking up joints on the sidewalk
And in the front drive talking to myself
Either that or inside hiding often to going somewhere quiet
Trying not to be noticed because I'm crying and sobbing
I had a bad day at school so I ain't talking
Some cocksucker shoved me into a fucking locker
Because he said I eyeballed him
[Bridge]
And if you fall, ill get you there
I'll be your savior from all the words
that are inside your world
Please have faith in my words
Because... this is my legacy, legacy, ehh
There's no guarantee, it's not up to me looking
This is my legacy, legacy
I used to be the type of kid would always think
the sky is falling
Why am I so differently wired Am I
[Verse 2: Eminem]
I used to be the type of kid would always think
the sky is falling
Why am I so differently wired? Am I a Nogging?
Cuz' sporadic as my thoughts come its mind boggling
Cuz I obsess on everything and my mind it's small shit
Bothers me but now my father he said cyanoira
and split but I don't give a shit. I'm fine along
as theirs batteries in my Walkman
nothing is the matter with me
Shit look at the bright side at least I ain't walking
I bike ride through the neighborhood of my apartment
complex on a ten speed which
I've acquired parts I found in the garbage
a frame and put tires on it, headphones
on straight ahead and gives a *** shit, but if this
Try and put up a fight's nonsense, but i think
What about those rhymes I've been jottin'
Instead of tryina escape through my comics, why don't I
To put me in the mood to wanna fight and write songs that
Say what I wanna say to the kid that said that I eyeballed him
Grab hold of my balls like that's right fight's on bitch
Who would've knew from the moment I turned the mic on
I could be iconic, and my conquest is worth to fight"
Asshole ,The Marshall Mathers LP 2,2013,"[verse: 1]
Came to the world in a time where it was in need of a villain
An asshole that well I think I succeeded in fulfilling
Better not think I will ever stop
To think I was speaking to children
Everything was happening so fast
That was... then everything went blank
All I remember
Is feeling ridiculous cause I was getting sick of this feeling
Like I am always under attack man
I could stack my shit list to the ceiling
Women dish him but really thinking
If someone talks to my little girls like this I would kill him
Guess I'm a little bit of a hypocrite
When I'm ripping shit
[2: 55 to end]
Holy mackeral, I'm the biggest jerk on the planet earth
I smack your girl off the mechanical bull, then attract the bull
Thinkin we have some magnetic pull
Screamin icp in this bitch, how do fuckin magnets work!
Cause your ejaculate, we ain't attractable
Hate to be dramatical, but I'm not romantical
I'm making up words you can understandable. it's tragical
Thinkin some magical shit's gonna happen?
that ain't practical. you crackin a joke
it's laughable, cause me and love's
like a bad combination, I keep them feelings
locked in a vault, so it's safe to say I'm uncrackable
my heart is truly guarded, fullbody armor
Bitch you just need a helmet
because if you think you're special, you're retarded
thinkin you're one of a kind
like you got some platinum vagina, you're a train wreck
I got a one track mind
Shorty you're fine but you sort of remind me of a 49er
Cause you been a gold digger since you were a minor
Been tryina, hunt me down like a dog
cause you're on my ass
But you can't get a scent
because all of my spare time is spent
With my nose in this binder, so don't bother tryin
Only women that I love are my daughters
And sometimes I rhyme and it sounds
like I forget I'm a father, and I push it farther
So father forgive me if I forget to draw the line
It's apparent I shouldn't of been a parent I'll never grow up
So to hell with your parents, and motherfucking father time
It ain't never gonna stop. a pessimist
who transforms you to optimus in his prime
so even if I'm half dead, I'm half alive
Throw all my half empty glass in a cup
so now my cup is runneth over
And I'm about to set it on you like a motherfucking coaster
I'm goin back to what got me here, yeah cocky
and can't not been? rude off? so fear not my dear
and dry up your teardrops I'm here
White america's mirror
so I feel awkward and weird, you stare at me
and see yourself, because you're one too
you shouldn't be as shocked, because everybody knows"
Berzerk,The Marshall Mathers LP 2,2013,"Now this shit's about to kick off
This party looks wack
Let's take it back to straight hip-hop and start it from scratch
I'm 'bout to bloody this track up, everybody get back
That's why my pen needs a pad
'Cause my rhymes on the rag
Just like I did with addiction, I'm 'bout to kick it
Like a magician, critics I turn to crickets
Got 'em still on the fence whether to picket
But quick to get it impaled when I tell 'em, ""Stick it! ""
So sick I'm looking pale, wait
That's my pigment
'Bout to go ham, ya bish, shout out to Kendrick
Let's bring it back to that vintage Slim, bitch!
The art of MCing mixed with da Vinci and MC Ren
And I don't mean Stimpy's friend, bitch
Been Public Enemy
since you thought PE was gym, bitch
Kick your shoes off, let your hair down
(And go berserk) all night long
Grow your beard out, just weird out
(And go berserk) all night long
We're gonna rock this house until we knock it down
So turn the volume loud
'Cause it's mayhem 'til the A. M
So, baby, make just like K-Fed
And let yourself go, let yourself go
Say ""Fuck it! "" before we kick the bucket
Life's too short to not go for broke
So everybody, everybody, go berserk
Grab your vial, yeah
Guess it's just the way that I'm dressed, ain't it?
Khakis pressed, Nike shoes crispy and fresh laced
So I guess it ain't that aftershave
Or cologne that made 'em just faint
Plus I showed up with a coat fresher than wet paint
So if love is a chess game, check mate
But girl, your body's bangin'
Jump me in, dang, bang-bang
Yes siree 'Bob', I was thinking the same thang
So come get on this Kid's rock
baw with da baw, dang-dang
Pow-p-p-p-pow, chica, pow, chica, wow-wow
Got your gal blowin' up a valve, valve-valve
Ain't slowin' down, throw in the towel, towel-towel
Dumb it down, I don't know how, huh-huh, how-how
At least I know that I don't know
Question is
are you bozos smart enough to feel stupid?
Hope so, now ho…
Kick your shoes off, let your hair down

Grow your beard out, just weird out

We're gonna rock this house until we knock it down

Say ""Fuck it! "" before we kick the bucket
Life's too short to not go for broke
So everybody, everybody, go berzerk
Get your vinyls!
They say that love is powerful as cough syrup in styrofoam
All I know is I fell asleep and woke up in that Monte Carlo
With the ugly Kardashian, Lamar, oh
Sorry yo, we done both set the bar low
Far as hard drugs are though, that's the past
But I done did enough codeine to knock Future into tomorrow
And girl, I ain't got no money to borrow
But I am tryin' to find a way to get you alone: car note
Oh, Marshall Mathers
Shithead with a potty mouth, get the bar of soap lathered
Kangol's and Carheartless Cargos
Girl, you're fixin' to get your heart broke
Don't be absurd, ma'am, you birdbrain, baby
I ain't called anybody baby since Birdman
unless you're a swallow
Word, Rick? (Word, man, you heard)
But don't get discouraged, girl
This is your jam, unless you got toe jam
Kick your shoes off, let your hair down

Grow your beard out, just weird out

We're gonna rock this house until we knock it down

Rap God,The Marshall Mathers LP 2,2013,"Look, I was gonna go easy on you
And not to hurt your feelings
But I'm only going to get this one chance
Something's wrong, I can feel it
Just a feeling I've got
Like something's about to happen
But I don't know what
If that means, what I think it means
We're in trouble, big trouble
And if he is as bananas as you say
I'm not taking any chances
You were just what the doctor ordered
I'm beginning to feel like a Rap God, Rap God
All my people from the front to the back nod, back nod
Now who thinks their arms
Are long enough to slapbox, slapbox?
They said I rap like a robot
So call me Rapbot
But for me to rap like a computer
Must be in my genes
I got a laptop in my back pocket
My pen'll go off when I half-cock it
Got a fat knot from that rap profit
Made a living and a killing off it
Ever since Bill Clinton was still in office
With Monica Lewinsky feeling on his nut-sack
I'm an Mc still as honest
But as rude and as indecent as all hell
Syllables, killaholic (Kill 'em all with)
This slickety, gibbedy, hibbedy hip hop
You don't really wanna get into a pissing match
With this rappidy rap
Packing a Mac in the back of the Ac
Pack backpack rap, yep, yackidy-yac
And at the exact same time
I attempt these lyrical acrobat stunts
While I'm practicing that
I'll still be able to break a motherfuckin' table
Over the back of a couple of faggots and crack it in half
Only realized it was ironic
I was under Aftermath after the fact
How could I not blow?
All I do is drop F-bombs
Feel my wrath of attack
Rappers are having a rough time period
Here's a maxipad
It's actually disastrously bad for the wack
While I'm masterfully constructing this masterpiece as
I'm beginning to feel like a Rap God, Rap God
All my people from the front to the back nod, back nod
Now who thinks their arms
Are long enough to slapbox, slapbox?
Let me show you maintaining
This shit ain't that hard, that hard
Everybody want the key
And the secret to rap immortality like I have got
Well, to be truthful the blueprint's simply rage
And youthful exuberance
Everybody loves to root for a nuisance
Hit the earth like an asteroid
Did nothing but shoot for the moon since
Mc's get taken to school with this music
Cause I use it as a vehicle to bust a rhyme
Now I lead a new school full of students
Me? I'm a product of Rakim, Lakim Shabazz, 2pac N
W. A, Cube, hey, Doc, Ren, Yella, Eazy
Thank you, they got Slim
Inspired enough to one day grow up
Blow up and be in a position
To meet Run Dmc and induct them
Into the motherfuckin' Rock n' Roll Hall of Fame
Even though I walk in the church
And burst in a ball of flames
Only Hall of Fame I be inducted in is the alcohol of fame
On the wall of shame
You fags think it's all a game
'Til I walk a flock of flames
Off of planking, tell me what in the fuck are you thinking?
Little gay looking boy
So gay I can barely say it
With a straight face looking boy
You witnessing a massacre
Like you watching a church gathering
Take place looking boy
Oy vey, that boy's gay
That's all they say looking boy
You get a thumbs up, pat on the back
And a way to go from your label everyday
Looking boy
Hey, looking boy, what you say looking boy?
I got a ""hell yeah"" from Dre looking boy
I'mma work for everything I have
Never ask nobody for shit
Get outta my face looking boy
Basically boy you're never gonna be capable
To keep up with the same pace looking boy
I'm beginning to feel like a Rap God, Rap God
All my people from the front to the back nod, back nod
The way I'm racing around the track
Call me Nascar, Nascar
Dale Earnhardt of the trailer park
The White Trash God
Kneel before General Zod this planet's Krypton
No Asgard, Asgard
So you be Thor and I'll be Odin
You rodent, I'm omnipotent
Let off then I'm reloading immediately
With these bombs I'm totin'
And I should not be woken
I'm the walking dead, but I'm just a talking head
A zombie floating
But I got your mom deep throating
I'm out my ramen noodle
We have nothing in common, poodle
I'm a doberman, pinch yourself in the arm
And pay homage, pupil
It's me, my honesty's brutal
But it's honestly futile if I don't utilize what I do though
For good at least once in a while
So I wanna make sure somewhere
In this chicken scratch I scribble and doodle
Enough rhymes to maybe to try
And help get some people through tough times
But I gotta keep a few punchlines just in case
'Cause even you unsigned
Rappers are hungry looking at me
Like it's lunchtime
I know there was a time where once I
Was king of the underground
But I still rap like I'm on my Pharoahe Monch grind
So I crunch rhymes, but sometimes when you combine
Appeal with the skin color of mine
You get too big
And here they come trying to censor you
Like that one line I said on ""I'm Back""
From the Marshall Mathers Lp
One where I tried to say I take seven kids from Columbine
Put 'em all in a line, add an Ak-47, a revolver and a nine
See if I get away with it now
That I ain't as big as I was
But I've Morphed into an immortal coming through the portal
You're stuck in a timewarp from 2004 though
And I don't know what the fuck that you rhyme for
You're pointless as Rapunzel with fucking cornrows
You're like normal, fuck being normal
And I just bought a new Raygun from the future
To just come and shoot ya like
When Fabolous made Ray J mad
Cause Fab said he looked like a fag
At Maywhether's pad
Singin' to a man while they played piano
Man, oh man, that was a 24 7 special
On the cable channel
So Ray J went straight to the radio station the very next day
''Hey, Fab, I'mma kill you''
Lyrics coming at you at supersonic speed
(Jj Fad)
Uh, sama lamaa duma lamaa
You assuming I'm a human
What I gotta do to get it through to you
I'm superhuman
Innovative and I'm made of rubber
So that anything you saying
Ricocheting off of me
And it'll glue to you
I'm never stating
More than never demonstrating
How to give a motherfuckin' audience
A feeling like it's levitating
Never fading
And I know that the haters are forever waiting
For the day that they can say I fell off
They'd be celebrating
'Cause I know the way to get 'em motivated
I make elevating music, you make elevator music
Oh, he's too mainstream
Well, that's what they do
When they get jealous, they confuse it
It's not hip hop, it's pop, cause I found a hella way to fuse it
With rock, shock rap with Doc
Throw on Lose Yourself and make 'em lose it
I don't know how to make songs like that
I don't know what words to use
Let me know when it occurs to you
While I'm ripping any one of these verses
Diverse as you
It's curtains, I'm inadvertently hurtin' you
How many verses I gotta murder to prove
That if you're half as nice at songs
You can sacrifice virgins too
School flunkie, pill junky
But look at the accolades the skills brung me
Full of myself, but still hungry
I bully myself cause I make me do
What I put my mind to
And I'm a million leagues above you
Ill when I speak in tongues
But it's still tongue in cheek, fuck you
I'm drunk so Satan take the fucking wheel
I'm asleep in the front seat
Bumping Heavy D and the Boys, still ""Chunky, But Funky""
But in my head there's something
I can feel tugging and struggling
Angels fight with devils
Here's what they want from me
They asking me to eliminate
Some of the women hate
But if you take into consideration
The bitter hatred that I had
Then you may be a little patient
And more symphatetic to the situation
And understand the discrimation
But fuck it, life's handing you lemons, make lemonade then
But if I can't batter the women how the fuck
Am I supposed to bake them a cake then?
Don't mistake it for Satan
It's a fatal mistake if you think I need to be overseas
And take a vacation to trip a broad
And make her fall on her face and don't be a retard
Be a king? Think not
Why be a king when you can be a God?"
Stronger Than I Was,The Marshall Mathers LP 2,2013,"[Verse 1]
You used to say that I'd never be
nothing without you and I believe
I'm striving the roads,
I guess I can't breathe
just lay here with me, baby,
hold me please
And I beg and I plead, drop to knees
And I cry and I scream, baby, please don't leave
Snatch the keys from your hand
I would squeeze and you'd laugh
And you'd tease, you're just fucking with me
And you must hate me
Why do you date me
if you say I make you sick?
And you've had enough of me
I smother you, I'm about
to jump off the edge
[Hook]
But you won't break me
You just make me stronger than I was
Before I met you, I'll bet you
I'll be just fine without you
And if I stumble, I won't crumble
I get back up and aah
And I'mma still be humble when I scream fuck you
Cause I'm stronger than I was
[Verse 2]
A beautiful face is all that you had
Cause on the inside you're ugly, man
But you're all that I love
I guess you can't leave
Please stay here with me, baby, hold me please
And I beg and I plead, drop to knees
And I cry and I scream, baby, please don't leave
Cause you left and you took everything I had left
And left nothing, nothing for me
So please don't wake me from this dream, baby
We're still together in my head
And you're still in love with me
Till I woke up to discover
that dream was dead
[Hook]
But you won't break me
You just make me stronger than I was
Before I met you, I'll bet you
I'll be just fine without you
And if I stumble, I won't crumble
I get back up and aah
And I'mma still be humble when I scream fuck you
Cause I'm stronger than I was
[Verse 3]
You walked out, I almost died
It was almost a homicide that you caused
cause I was so traumatized
Felt like I was in for a long bus ride
I'd rather die than not you by my side
Can't count how many times I vomited, cried
Go to my room, turn the radio on and hide
You were Bonnie and Clyde
No, on the inside you were Jekyll and Hyde
Felt like my whole relationship
with you was a lie
It was you and I, why did I think it was ride
or die?
cause if you could've took my life
you would've
It's like you put a knife to my chest
and pushed it right through to the
other side of my pack, stuck a spike,
you should've
put up more of a fight, but I couldn't
at the time no one could hurt me like you could've
Take you back now, what's the likelihood of that?
Bite me, bitch, chewing on a nineteen footer
Cause this morning I finally stood up
Held my chin up,
finally showed a sign of life for me for the
First time since you left me and left me
with nothing but shattered dreams
And a life we could've had and we
could've been
But I'm breaking out of this lump I'm in
Pulling myself out of the dump once again
I'm getting up once and for all, fuck this shit
I'mma be late for the pity party
But you're never gonna beat me
to the fucking punch again
Took it on the chin like a champ
so don't lump me in with the chumpy ends
I'm done being your punching bag
It was the November 31st today
would've been our anniversary
Two years, but you left on the first of May
I wrote it on the calender, was gonna call
but couldn't think of the words to say
But it came to me just now,
so I put them in a verse to lay
And I thank you
cause you made me a better person than I was
But I hate you cause you drained me
I gave you all, you gave me none
But if you blame me you're crazy
And after all that's said and done
I'm still angry, yeah, I may be
I may never trust someone
[Hook]
But you won't break me
You just make me stronger than I was
Before I met you, I'll bet you
I'll be just fine without you
And if I stumble, I won't crumble
I get back up and aah
And I'mma still be humble when I scream fuck you
Cause I'm stronger than I was"

""Who can say for sure?
Perhaps a frontal lobotomy would be the answer
If science could operate on this distorted brain
and put it to good use
Society would reap a great benefit.""
[Verse 1]
I walk around like a space cadet, place your bets
Who's likely to become a serial killer, case of Tourettes
Fuck, fuck-fuck, can't take the stress
I make a mess as the day progresses
Angry and take it out on the neighbors hedges
Like this is how I'll cut your face up bitches
With these hedge trimming scissors with razor edges
Imagination's dangerous, it's
The only way to escape this mess and make the best of this
situation I guess
Cause I feel like a little bitch, this predicament's
Despicable, I'm sick of just gettin' pushed, it's ridiculous
I look like a freakin' wuss, a pussy, this kid just took
My stick of licorice and threw my sticker books in a picker bush
I wanna kick his tush, but I was six and shook
This fucker was twelve and was six foot, with a vicious hook
He hit me, I fell; I got back up, all I did was book
Now there's using your head
Momma always said
[Hook]
If you had a brain, you'd be dangerous
A brain, you'd be dangerous
I'ma prove you wrong
Momma, I'mma grow one day to be famous
And I'mma be a pain in the anus
I'ma be the bomb
I'ma use my head as a weapon
Find a way to escape this insaneness
Momma always said,
""Son, if you had a brain, you'd be dangerous""
Guess it pays to be brainless
[Verse 2]
Fast forward some years later, a teenager; this is fun, sweet
I just got jumped twice in one week, it's complete
It's usually once a month, this is some feat
I've accomplished, they've stomped me into the mud,
gee for what reason, you stumped me
But how do you get the shit beat out of you
beat down and be upbeat when you don't have nothing?
No valid shot at life, chance to make it or succeed
Cause you're doomed from the start
it's like you grew up on Jump Street, from jump street
But if I could just get my head out my ass
I could accomplish any task
Practicing trash talkin'
In a trance locked in my room, yeah
but I got some plans, Momma
These damn rhymes are falling out of my pants pocket,
I can't stop it
And I'm starting to blend in more
In school this shit helps for sure
I'm getting more self-assured than I've ever been before
Plus no one picks on me anymore, I done put a stop to that
threw my first punch - end of story
Still in my skull is a vacant empty void,
been using it more as a bin for storage
Take some inventory
In this gourd there's a Ford engine, door hinge, syringe,
an orange, an extension cord, and a Ninja sword, not to mention
four linchpins an astringent stored
Ironing board, a bench, a wrench an oru winch
an attention whore
Everything but a brain, but dome's off the fucking chain like an
independent store
Something's wrong with my head
Just think if I had a brain in it, thank God that I don't
Cause I'd probably be Dahmer, cause Momma always said
[Hook]
If you had a brain, you'd be dangerous
A brain, you'd be dangerous
I'ma prove you wrong
Momma, I'mma grow one day to be famous
And I'mma be a pain in the anus
I'ma be the bomb
I'ma use my head as a weapon
Find a way to escape this insaneness
Momma always said,
""Son, if you had a brain, you'd be dangerous""
Guess it pays to be brainless
[Bridge]
Now my Mom goes wahm-wahm-wahm
Cause I'm not that smart, but I'm not dumb
I was on a bottom of the pile getting stomped
But somehow, I came out on top
[Verse 3]
I told you one day, I said they'd have that red carpet rolled out, yo
I'm nice, yo, fuck it, I'm out cold
Now everywhere I go they scream out go
I'm 'bout to clean house, yo
I'm Lysol, now I'm just household
Outsold the sell-outs, freak the hell out Middle America,
hear 'em yell out in terror they were so scared and those kids
Just about, belted out whatever spouted or fell out of my smart
aleck mouth, it was so weird
Inappropriate, so be it, I don't see it
Maybe one day when the smoke clears, it won't be as
Mothafucking difficult, ch-yeah, 'til then, hopefully ya
Little homos get over your fears and phobias
It's okay to be scared straight, they said I provoke queers
'Til emotions evoke tears, my whole career's
A stroke of sheer genius, smoke and mirrors,
tactical, practical jokes, yeah
You mothafuckin' (insert insult here)
Who the fuck would've thunk that one little ole MC'd
Be able to take the whole culture and re-upholstery it?
And boy, they did flock; can't believe this little hick locked
This hip-hop shit in his hip pocket and still the shit got
That white trash traffic in gridlock, shit hopping like six blocks
From a Kid Rock, Insane Clown Posse Concert in mid Oc-
-Tober, and God forbid I see a wizard
and get a brain in my titanium cranium y'all, cause
I'll turn into the Unabomber, Momma always said
[Hook]
If you had a brain, you'd be dangerous

I'm friends with the monster
that's under my bed
Get a long with the voices inside of my head
You trying to save me
Stop holding your breath
And you think I'm crazy
yeah, you think I'm crazy
Eminem
I wanted the fame
but not the cover of Newsweek
Oh well, guess beggars can't be choosey
Wanted to receive attention for my music
Wanted to be left alone in public, excuse me
Been wanting my cake, and eat it too
And wanting it both ways
Fame made me a balloon
cause my ego inflated
When I blew; see, it was confusing
Cause all I wanted to do is
Be the Bruce Lee of loose leaf
Abused ink, used it as a tool
When I blew steam (wooh!)
Hit the lottery, oh wee
With what I gave up to get was bittersweet
With this like winning a huge meet
Ironic cause I think I'm getting so huge
I need a shrink
I'm beginning to lose sleep
One sheep, two sheep
Going cuckoo and cooky as Kool Keith
But I'm actually weirder than you think
Cause I'm

Well, that's nothing

No, I ain't much of a poet
But I know somebody once told me
To seize the moment and don't squander it
'Cause you never know when it all could be over tomorrow
So I keep conjuring
Sometimes I wonder where these thoughts spawn from
(Yeah, ponder it, do you want this?
No wonder you losing your mind
The way it wanders)
Yo-lo-lo-lo-yee-whoo
I think you've been wandering off down yonder
And stumbled onto Jeff Vanvonderen
'Cause I need an interventionist
To intervene between me and this monster
And save me from myself and all this conflict
'Cause the very thing that I love is killing me
And I can't conquer it
My Ocd is conking me in the head
Keep knocking, nobody's home, I'm sleepwalking
I'm just relaying what the voice
In my head's saying
Don't shoot the messenger, I'm just friends with the
Rihanna
I'm friends with the monster that's under my bed
Get a long with the voices inside of my head
You trying to save me
Stop holding your breath
And you think I'm crazy, yeah, you think I'm crazy
Well, that's nothing
Well, that's nothing
Eminem
Call me crazy, but I have this vision
One day that I walk amongst you a regular civilian
But until then drums get killed and I'm coming straight at
Emcees, blood get spilled and I
Take it back to the days that I get on a Dre track
Give every kid who got played at
Pumped up feeling and shit to say back
To the kids who played 'em
I ain't here to save the fucking children
But if one kid out of a hundred million
Who are going through a struggle feels
And then relates that's great
It's payback, Russell Wilson falling way back
In the draft, turn nothing into something
Still can make that
Straw into gold chump
I will spin Rumpelstiltskin in a haystack
Maybe I need a straight jacket, face facts
I am nuts for real, but I'm okay with that
It's nothing, I'm still friends with the
Rihanna
I'm friends with the monster that's under my bed
Get a long with the voices inside of my head

So Far,The Marshall Mathers LP 2,2013,"[Intro]
I own a mansion, but live in a house
A king-size bed, but I sleep on the couch
I'm Mr. Brightside, glass is half full
But my tank is half empty, gas kit just blew
[Verse 1]
This always happens, 30 minutes from home
Gotta lay a long cable
and only option I have is McDonald's bathroom
In a public stall dropping a football
So every time someone walks in the john like at Madden
''Shady, what up? ''- What? Come on, man, I'm crapping
And you're asking me for my godamn autograph on a napkin?
Oh, that's odd, I just happened to run out of tissue
Yeah, hand me that, on second thought I'd be glad then
''Thanks, dawg, name's Todd, a big fan''
I wiped my ass with it, crumbled it up [?] back and
Told him ''Todd, you're the shit''
when does all of this crap end?
Can't park my [?] without causing an accident
Puff my gas, cut my grass, can't take out the fucking trash
Without someone passing through my sub harassing
I'd count my blessings, but I suck at math
I'd rather wallow then bass suffering from succotash
But the [?] is my stomach as
I mix my corn with my fucking mash
Potato, so what, ho, kiss my country bucking ass
Missouri Southern roots, what the fuck is up with glass?
Call lunch dinner, call dinner supper
Tupperware in a covered plastic wear up the ass
Stuck in the past, iPod, what the fuck is that?
B-boy to the core, mule, I'm a stubborn ass
[Hook]
Maybe that's why I feel so strange
Got it all, but I still won't change
Maybe that's why I can't leave Detroit
It's the motivation that keeps me going
This is the inspiration I need
I can never turn my back on a city that made me
(Life's been good to me so far)
[Verse 2]
They call me [?] , I heard that, I second and third that
Don't know what the fuck I would doing if it weren't rap
Probably be a giant turd-sack
But I blew, never turned back
Turned 40 and still sag
Teenagers act more fucking mature, Jack
Fuck you gonna say to me?
I live on my own terms, asshole, I'm going berzerk
My nerves are bad, but I love the perks my work has
I get to meet famous people, look at her, dad
Her eyeliners ran, her skirt snag
And I heard she drag-races, burp* swag
Fucking my Hanes shirt tag
You're Danica Patrick (yeah) work, skag
We'd be the perfect match
Cause you're a vacuum, I'm a dirtbag
My apologies, no disrespect to technology
But what the heck is all of these buttons?
You expect me to sit here and learn that?
Fuck I gotta do to hear this new song from Luda?
Be and expert at computers?
I'd rather be an encyclopedia [?] Playstation
I'm still on my first manual from Zelda
Nintendo, bitch, run, jump, punch, stab and I melt the
Mozzarella on my spaghetti, put in on bread
Make a sandwich with [?] and belts
They say it's [?] , but it's bad for my health
But I think there's more white trash from the trailer
[?] welfare mentality helps to keep me grounded
that's why I never take full advantage of wealth
I Managed to dwell within these perimeters
still cramming the shells full of hamburger helper
I can't even help it, this is the hand I was dealt to
[?] a habit, feel like I'm trapped in an animal shelter
With all these pet peeves
Got dammit to hell
I can't stand all these kids with their camera cellphones
I can't go anywhere, I get so mad I can yell the
Other day someone got little elaborate
and stuck a fucking dead cat in my mailbox
Went to Burger King, they spit on my onion rings
I think my karma is catching up with me

Maybe that's why I feel so strange
Got it all, but I still won't change
Maybe that's why I can't leave Detroit
It's the motivation that keeps me going
This is the inspiration I need

Got friends on facebook, all over the world
Not sure what that means, they tell me it's good
So I'm artist of the decade, I even got a plaque
I'd hang it up, but the frame is all cracked
[Verse 3]
Trying to be lowkey, hopefully nobody notices me
[?] got punched over, giant nosebleed
As I mosey over to the frozen isle
By the frozen yogurt this guy approached me
Embarrassed, I just did [?] America with Hova
Show's over, I'm hiding in [?] buying groceries
He had front row seats, told me to sign this poster
Then insults me ''wow, up close
didn't know you had gross feet''
Still shopping at Costco
Sloppy Joe's, buck waffles
Got caught picking my nose, ah
Look over see these two hot hoes
Finger still stuck up in one of my nostrils
Right next to him stuck at the light
This fucking shit is taking forever to change
I'm stuck, these bitches are loving it rubbing it in
Couldn't do nothing, play it off
''What you bumping? Trunk Muzik? Yelawolf's better''
fucking bitch
They want me to flip at the label, but I won't succumb to it
The pressure, they want me to follow up
with another one after Recovery
So highly coveted, but what good is a fucking recovery
if I fumble it?
Cause I'mma drop the ball if I don't get to quit
On you sons of bitches
Quit snapping pictures of my fucking kids
I love my [?] , but you push me to my limit, what a pity
The shit I complain about
It's like there ain't a cloud in the sky and it's raining out
Kool Aid stain on the couch, I'd never get it out
Bitch, I got an elevator in my house

Love Game ,The Marshall Mathers LP 2,2013,"[verse 1: eminem]
Somethin's burnin', I can't figure out what
It's either lust or a cloud of dust
Judgement is clouded
Must just be the powder from the power of love
But I'm in somethin' I don't know how to get out of
Left my girl in the house alone
Is that my soon to be spouse's moan
And the further I walked allowed her
I paused for a minute to make something, that's what I heard
Cuz after all this is her place
So I gave her the benefit of the doubt
Think I might be about busta busta
The thought's so scary, yo that it hurts, brace
Hope it ain't, there we go, yo
Cause my head already goes to worst case scenario
Though, in the first place
But you confirmed my low end theory, though
Should've known when I made it all the way to third base
And that was only the first date
Coulda made it to home plate
But you slid straight for the dome and dove face first
No, you don't, under, stand, I, don't, do this for
Anyone, ever, yeah that ain't what they all say
I'll say it, you can suck a softball through a straw
Used to be my fiance
'til you sucked on wayne, andre, and kanye
Lebron, akon, jay, lil jon, raekwon, ma$e
Polow tha don, drake, dante ross, james conway, kwame
Guess I'm gettin my goddamn jigga on
Cause your name, I'm beyond sayin'
But fuck it, I'm movin' on, you women are all crack
But I'll probably always keep playin' the game of

She doesn't love me, no she don't love me no more
She hates my company, yeah she don't love me no more
I tried to get her up out of my head as my bags hit the door
She screamed she loves me like she never did before
[and I told her go where you want
And go do what you want to do. I don't care] x2
[verse 2: kendrick lamar]
I told that bitch
I'm a sucker for love, you're a sucker for dick
Suckin' dick in your momma's tub 'til your granny walked in
Told the stupid nigga to duck under the water, he drowned
Like abortion, they booked you for manslaughter
You beat the case and I called you
""sherane is not available but leave a message at the tone
And kendrick don't forget to buy two pair of those
Expensive heels, you fuckin' little ferris wheel
Fuckin' spendin' on me, fuck you
Think we gon' get married still?
Fuckin' mary had a little lamb, this ain't no fairy tale
Fairy godmomma better tell you how I fuckin' feel
Like you should fuckin' beat it and fuckin' eat it
While I'm on my period
Now have a blessed day""
Bitch you serious? I'm in the mirror
With this look on my face, curious
Why you ain't fuckin' with me, you cut me up, a caesarean
You know I want you bad as a benjamin, I'm delirious
I want you bad
As the head shattered on george zimmerman
After the dillinger hit'em diligently and killin' him
His mouthpiece for a cadillac emblem
That's analogy and metaphor for yah
I should win a medal for all the ways I adore yah
This is me talkin' poetry, yeah I got some home trainin'
That ain't what you like, ain't it? what about if I was famous
As marshall, would you give fellatio in the carpool
Cops pull us over, they just wanna know if you gargle, singin'
I hope she's good enough, meanwhile you're chasin' her
Chlamydia couldn't even get rid of her

[verse 3: eminem]
So needless to say I'm feeling betrayed
Snatched my housekey off my keychain
She jumped off, wee-bay from the wire, escape
Now she's chasin' me with a cheese grater
Here goes that broken record, cliche, it's all my fault anyway
She's turnin' the tables, I'm a beat-break
Treats my face like seratos, she cuts and scratches like a dj
Each day is an instant replay
They sayin' we display cinethematic abatic behavior
Back together but forgot today was her b-day
Cut me off on the freeway
Simple misunderstandin'
But just as I went to slam on the brakes
Then I realized that she may be as crazy as me, wait
Bitch cut my fuckin' brakeline
Stepped on them fuckers 8 times
Still goin' 73, thank god there's an exit coming up
But them other f-u-c-k's all would of hit the off ramp
So I coast into a gosh damned aww hit a fuckin' tree
Now here she comes at full speed
She's racin' at me, okay you wanna fuck with me, eh?
Snatch the bitch out her car through the window
She screamin'
I bodyslam her onto the cement
Until the concrete gave and created a sinkhole
Bury this stink ho in it, then payed
To have the street re-paved
Fuck, woke up in a dream state in a cold sweat
Like I got hit with a freeze ray durin' a heat wave
Guess I eventually caved though
Cause she's layin' next to me in bed
Directly aimin' a gat at my head
Woke up again and jumped up like fuck it
I've had it, I'm checkin' into rehab
I confess I'm a static addict, I guess that's why I'm so clingy
Every girl I've ever had either says I got to much baggage
Or I'm just too dramatic
Man what the fuck is the matter? I'm just a fucking romantic
I fucking love you, you fucking bitch!
Combative, possessive, in fact last time I was mad at an ex
I actually set off a chain reaction, a tragic event
I said ""hit the road"" and after she left
I sent I sent a barrage of texts
I said ""be careful driving, don't read this
And have a accident""
She glanced to look at it and write right, too bad
Thought we had a connect
No sense dwelling makes
Never been a more compelling case
Than a model covered in l'oreal and mace
Who fell from grace
Eleven stories for story telling
But the whore was yelling ""rape""
So the vocal cords were swelling and her voice
Were more hoarser than tori spelling's face
Still they swarm the gates and my fans making stakes
To greet norman bates with a warm embrace
Unless you're andrea yates
Don't ask me for a date, don't be late
Well the sentiments great
But wait then there's been a mistake
You want an intimate date, I wanna intimidate
I have infinite hate in my blood
It's mainly because of the game of

Wait dinner at eight

Headlights ,The Marshall Mathers LP 2,2013,"Mom
I know I let you down
And though you say the days are happy
Why is the power off, and I'm fucked up?
Mom
I know he's not around
But don't you place the blame on me
As you pour yourself another drink
I guess we are who we are
Headlights shining in the dark night I drive on
Maybe we took this too far
I went in headfirst
Never thinking about who what I said hurt
In what verse
My mom probably got it the worst
The brunt of it, but as stubborn as we are
Did I take it too far?
""Cleaning Out My Closet"" and all them other songs
But regardless I don't hate you cause ma!
You're still beautiful to me, cause you're my mom
Though far be it for you to be calling
My house was Vietnam
Desert storm and both of us put together
Can form an atomic bomb equivalent
To chemical warfare
And forever we can drag this on and on
But, agree to disagree
That gift from me up under the Christmas tree
Don't mean shit to me
You're kicking me out?
It's 15 degrees and it's Christmas Eve
(little prick just leave)
Ma, let me grab my fucking coat
Anything to have each other's goats
Why we always at each others throats?
Especially when dad, he fucked us both
We're in the same fucking boat
You'd think that it'd make us close (nope)
Further away it drove us
But together headlights shine, a car full of belongings
Still got a ways to go, back to grandma's house
It's straight up the road
And I was the man of the house, the oldest
So my shoulders carried the weight of the load
Then Nate got taken away by the state at 8 years old, and
That's when I realized you were sick
And it wasn't fixable or changable
And to this day we remained estranged
And I hate it though, but
I guess we are who we are
Headlights shining in the dark night I drive on
Maybe we took this too far
Cause to this day we remain estranged and I hate it though
Cause you ain't even get to witness
Your grand baby's growth
But I'm sorry mama for ""Cleaning Out My Closet""
At the time I was angry
Rightfully maybe so
Never meant that far to take it though, cause
Now I know it's not your fault
And I'm not making jokes
That song I no longer play at shows
And I cringe every time it's on the radio
And I think of Nathan being placed in a home
And all the medicine you fed us
And how I just wanted you to taste your own, but
Now the medications taken over
And your mental states deteriorating slow
And I'm way too old to cry, that shit's painful though
But ma, I forgive you, so does Nathan yo
All you did, all you said
You did your best to raise us both
Foster care, that cross you bare
Few may be as heavy as yours
But I love you Debbie Mathers
Oh what a tangled web we have, cause
One thing I never asked was
Where the fuck my deadbeat dad was
Fuck it I guess he had trouble
Keeping up with every address
But I'd rather of flipped every mattress
Every rock and desert cactus
Own a collection of maps and followed my kids
To the edge of the atlas
Someone ever moved them from me?
That you could bet your ass's
If I had to come down the chimney dressed as Santa
Kidnap them
And although one has met their grandma
Once you pulled up in our drive one night
As we were leaving to get some hamburgers
Me, her and Nate, we introduced you, hugged you
And as you left I had this overwhelming sadness
Come over me
As we pulled off to go our separate paths, and
I saw your headlights as I looked back
And I'm mad I didn't get the chance to
Thank you for being my mom and my dad
So Mom, please accept this as a tribute
I wrote this on the jet
I guess I had to get this off my chest
I hope I get the chance to lay it before I'm dead
The stewardess said to fasten my seatbelt
I guess we're crashing
So if I'm not dreaming
I hope you get this message
That I'll always love you from afar
Cause you're my mama
I guess we are who we are
Headlights shining in the dark night I drive on
Maybe we took this too far
I want a new life
One without a cause
So I'm coming home tonight
Well, no matter what the cost
And if the plane goes down
And if the crew can't wake me up
Well, just know that I'm alright
And I was not afraid to die
Even if there's songs to sing
My children will carry me
Just know that I'm alright
I was not afraid to die
Because I put my faith in my new girl
So I never say goodbye cruel world
Just know that I'm alright
I am not afraid to die
I guess we are who we are
Headlights shining in the dark night I drive on
Maybe we took this too far
I want a new life"
Evil Twin,The Marshall Mathers LP 2,2013,"[intro]
Yeah, trying to figure out the difference
But I think... I think the lines are starting to get blurry
[verse 1]
I'm in a strange place
I feel like mase when he gave up the game for his faith
I feel like I'm caged in these chains and restraints
Grinning every stranger in the place while I gaze into space
Cause I'm mentally rearranging his face
I need a change of pace cause the pace
I'm working at is dangerous
There's nowhere to dump this anger
And thanks to this angst
I done quit chicken heads in cold turkey
And started slowly roasting 'em
Cause that's where most of my anger is based
Fuck your feelings, I feel like I play for the saints
I just want to hurt you, aim for the skanks
Then aim for all these fake kanye's, jay's, wayne's
And the drake's
I'm frustrated cause ain't no more N'sync
Now I'm all out of whack
I'm all out of backstreet boys to call out and attack
I'm going all out in this rap shit and whatever the fallout is
I'm strapped for battles
Suck a duck, crawl out the back, bar fight
Prepare your arsenal and beware of bar stools
Flying through the air
And bottles breaking, mirrors also
And I ain't stopping 'til the swear jar's full
You done called every woman a slut
But you forgetting sarah, marshall
Oh my bad, slut
And next time I show up in court I'll be naked
And square a lawsuit
Judge be like '' that's sharp, how much that motherfucker cost you?
Smart ass, you lucky I don't tear it off you
And jmp your bones, you sexy motherfucker
You so fucking gravy, marshall, I should start calling you ""au jus""
Cause all you do is spit them lyrics out the wazoo
Evil twin, take this beat now, it's on you''
I believe people can change, but only for the worse
I could've changed the world if it wasn't for this verse
So satanic K-Mark panic
Cause they can't even spin back the curse words
Cause it works when they're reversed, motherfucker
And these kids are like parrots
They run around the house just like terrorists
Screaming ''fuck, shit, fuck''
Adult with a child is like arrogance
Wild ever since the day I came out
I was like ''merits, fuck that''
I'd rather be loud and I like swearing
From the first album even the gals were like
''tight [?] , screamy eyes''
But my fucking mouth was nightmare-ish
And from the start of it you felt like you were a part of this
And the opposition felt the opposite
Sometimes I listen and revisit them old albums
Often as I can and skim through all them bitches
To make sure I keep up with my competition
[?] of beats, hoarder of rhymes
Borderline genius who's bored of his lines
And that sort of defines where I'm at and the way I feel now
Feel like I might just strike first and ignore the replies
[Hook:]
There?s darkness closing in (evil twin)
There it goes again (my evil twin),
It controls my pen (my evil twin),
But that ain?t me, it?s my evil twin
(then I step out and see my evil twin he gives me an evil grin)
But he?s just a friend (evil twin),
Who pops up now and again (again)
So don?t blame me (evil twin)
Blame him, it?s my evil twin
[interlude]
Welcome back to the land of the living, my friend
You have slept for quite some time
[Verse 2:]
So who's left? Lady Gaga? Mess with the Bieber
Nah, F with Christina, I ain't fucking with either Jessica neither
Simpson or Alba, my albums just sicker than struck with the fever
Get the Chloraseptic, Excedrin, Aleve or Extra Strength Tylenol 3?s
Feel like I'm burning to death, but I'm freezin'
Bed-ridden and destined never to leave the
Bedroom ever again like the legend of Heather Ledger
My suicide notes, barely legible read the
Bottom, it's signed by The Joker
Lorraine said I never can leave her
She'd sever my wiener I ever deceive her
Fuck that shit, bitch
Give up my dick for pussy, I'd be Jerry Mathers
I'd ever left it to Beaver
Get them titties cut off trying to mess with a cleaver
Golly-wally I bet he registered Jesus
Ever since 1-9-9-4-6 Dresden it was definitely my destiny
When on the steps I met Deshaun at Osborn
I'd never make it to sophomore
I just wanted to skip school and rap, used to mop floors
Flip burgers and wash dishes while I wrote rhymes trying to get props for 'em
'Cause I took book-smarts and swapped for 'em
They were sleeping, I made them stop snorin'
Made them break out the popcorn
Now I've been hip hop in its tip top form
Since N.W.A. was blaring through my car windows leaning on the horn
Screaming ""fuck the police"" like cop porn
Flipped rap on its ear like I dropped coin
Fuck top 5, bitch, I'm top 4
And that includes Biggie and Pac, whore
And I got an evil twin, so who the fuck you think that's 3rd and that 4th spot's for?
And crazy as I am I'm much tamer than him
And I'm nuts, then again who the fuck wants to plain Eminem?
But no one's insaner than Slim, look at that evil grin (evil twin)
Please come in, what was your name again?
Hi, faggot
Look who's back with a crab up his ass like a lobster crawled up there
Two rabbits, a koala bear and a ball of hair
And you're all aware I don't got it all upstairs
Guess that's why I'm an addict and it's just small up there
Peace to Whitney, geez, just hit me
That I should call the loony police to come get me
'Cause I'm so sick of being the truth I wish someone?d finally admit me
To a mental hospital with Britney
Oh, Lmfao, no way, ho
Jose Baez couldn't beat this rap, Oj no
Hooray, I'm off the hook like Casey Anthony
Hey ho, hey ho
I sound like I'm trying to sing the fucking chorus to hip hop hooray
No, I'm hollering, you got bottom in like an 8-0-8
And a base whether we're fucking of that instead of your face, so
Let your low-end raise, yo
Tango, what you think, ho?
Slow dancing in the bowling
You trying to hold hands with your homie?
What? You think I'm looking for romance 'cause I'm lonely?
Change that tune, you ain't got remote chance to control me
Hoe, I'm only vulnerable when I got a boner
Superman tried to fuck me over, it won't hurt
Don't try to fix me, I'm broke so I don't work
So are you, but you're broke 'cause you don't work
But all bullshit aside I hit a stride
Still Shady inside, hair every bit is dyed
As it used to be when I first introduced y'all to my skittish side
And blamed it on him when they tried to criticize
'Cause we are the same, bitch"
Desperation ,The Marshall Mathers LP 2,2013,"[Verse 1]
Girl you gimme writers block
I'm at a loss for words
My mind's as lost as yours
I rack my brain but still no thoughts emerge
Never seen no ass as large as yours, how much that cost?
That's what I call a Roethlisberger
You drive me bonkers I'm about to get my swerve on for sure
Thought I was pimping 'til I felt like Nas, the first date
Because I think I gave you power when I gave you flowers
And I bought us a box of chocolates
no lozenges, cough drops or syrups
Probably should of never let me call that job of yours
To talk to your boss and ask him
if you can take off from work
Should of been one of the first signs that caused alert
Man we jumped in too fast
cause since then I can't be apart from her
Cause nobodies body's awesomer
I lust it, and she loves me cause I'm popular, but...
[Hook]
You know this ain't love
Oh, no, you know this ain't love
You know this ain't love
No, this ain't love
(What is it then?) It's desperation
She's lookin for Mr. Right, wants me to be that guy to her
(It's desperation)
I can't even put up a fight, cause I give in at the sight of her
And here I go again
[Verse 2]
Well obviously, oblivious to me
I swore I was just invisible to you
til I went to the lengths I did to meet you
Cause you played so hard to get with me from the beginning
Now I'm in disbelief I, never knew
that this could be such misery
Cause now you see nothin but me
and I don't see nothin but you
And I'm about to flip cause we are super glued in
We stuck to each others hips
and we can't do anything individually
Which is to cling on, scared to be alone
can't, specifically to describe it
I just can't seem to give a reason this definitive, just need you
Talkin bout ""I live and breathe you""
And you pretend to be as mentally
and physically addicted to me
As much as Chris Kalil is to reefer
Don't wanna be without you
don't wanna be with you neither, bitch
Put me in a situation in which it's both I wish to seek
cause this ain't
[Hook]
You know this ain't love
Oh, no, you know this ain't love
You know this ain't love
No, this ain't love
(What is it then?) It's desperation
She's lookin for Mr. Right, wants me to be that guy to her
(It's desperation)
I can't even put up a fight, cause I give in at the sight of her
And here I go again
[Verse 3]
Just want you to myself
don't wanna share you with no one else
What the fuck you whispering for?
You get on my nerves, you make me sick
I think our relationship, it seems to be on the fridge
I mean, it's time that we just split and leave the games behind
Your frame of mind ain't the same as mine
I think you need to finish developing a little more mentally too
Get the picture? That's a negative, Alicia, I will never give the Keys up
To the crib, ever again, no reason not even a gift certificate from Tiffany's
You better have an epiphany, slut, guess what? Galisa
I'm just mad it took the time it took me to discover
You been using me for loot like I used you for looks
Thought you was too good for me, huh, yeah
Twat used to be my Carrie Underwood, I was your lumberjack
But I can't stomach this, I'm leaving you, I'm not coming back
She said ""The fuck with that, where's my Louisville Slugger at?""
She grabbed that fucking bat and swung it at my head
I barely ducked and that's right
When she came up with a kick to the nuts twice, steel toe
Girl probably coulda put a 100 yard field goal, through the uprights
[Hook]
You know this ain't love
Oh, no, you know this ain't love
You know this ain't love
No, this ain't love
(What is it then?) It's desperation
She's lookin for Mr. Right, wants me to be that guy to her
(It's desperation)
I can't even put up a fight, cause I give in at the sight of her
And here I go again (It's desperation)"
Baby,The Marshall Mathers LP 2,2013,"[Verse 1]
One thousand different houses and munchausen
I'mma make you wanna punch out some fuckin' one ""ouch""
What the fuck'd you hit me for?
Scream life as I punch counter and bunches out of anger
I once encountered a stranger
In a dumb gown, black hood
What a sight
Shit I laughed in his face spit
Bitch gave me an extra life, like take this
Get your ass back in that game
Bitch don't take shit for granted
And don't take shit, give it!
Only bull you should take is by the horns
A mixture of Whitey Ford and mighty Thor
I Everlast, pen is mightier then sword
Finish writing then record
Replenish keep writing more
Nothing's riding on it but your privates
are you're fighting for
So you fight, scratch, you claw
Backs to wall
No one was there to catch you fall
You pick yourself back up, you dust your jacket off
You grab your balls, like they're? and
Ask yourself how fucking bad you want it
Pull out your pants, whoop your ass and flash it on em'
Nobodies gonna back you in the corner
Throw a hornet
No one's more ig-norant
then you fuckin' four in the morning you're at?
storming Like there's nothing that's more important
MC's you better consider this a formal warning
you're in for it Girl, what would you do if I said
your body was off the chain?
And I told you I smile every single time I saw your face
I ain't finished bitch
I meant in half, oil the blades
Nobody wants to play
They say I'm a spoiled little baby
But
[Hook]
Nobody put's baby in the corner
I'm only trying to warn ya
Cus that baby get's mad
And get's to throwing a tantrum
He'll fucking flip on ya
Cus' nobody put's baby in the corner
I'm only trying to warn ya
Cus that baby get's mad
And get's to throwing a tantrum
He'll fucking flip on ya
[Verse 2]
What goes through an addict's brain?
Besides static pain and big daddy kane
Break, beats and words
An erratic train of thought
Like splatter paint
Scatter brain
Yeah maybe why that explains
Why you're back but you don't rap the same
And you're looking way thinner
Because your hunger got you looking like
A took away dinner
Sugar ray leonard wouldn't sugar coat
a fucking booger though
Just to wipe that bitch on a hooker's coat
When you say you're a chooka what chooka what
Now fling that bitch from your fingertips
I hope it lands on another rap singers lips
Who can't think of shit
Anything of wit, that's intresting to spit
Whose king of this fucking english lit?
Let your middle fingers flip
On each hand, whilst extending this shit
How low can you go?
Lower then Chuck D ho
Hear the bass of this in my voice
Rocky's back, where's my adrian
Nobodies crazy as shady in an eighty million mile radius
I'm what Tom Brady is to the patriots of rap
Not a man, I'm a weapon
Who just happened to be a rapper
Who just happen to be on the crapper
When it happened I had an epiphany
In the bathroom, I'd never be the same after
Now I'm back with an apper-tite
For destruction the fucking recipe for disaster
So let's eat cos' I'm fammished
Every deed is a bastardly one
Evil its past it
Even you asking for me to be pulled
Like to people
Is like me having my teeth pulled

Groundhog Day,The Marshall Mathers LP 2,2013,"What is a nightmare?
A dictionary tells us it is a terrifying dream, a nightmare
I used to think I had bad luck, but I wasn't superstitious
Till one day I grew suspcious
when I stepped on a crack on [?]
And got pooped on by a group of stupid pigeons
Then we flew the coop to Michigan to start a new begi [?]
Missuri from Michigan didn't work
So we moved back to Missouri from Michigan
from Misuri back to Michigan
Someone put me out my misery, I can't do this again
Mom please stick to a decision
Discipline, last thing I wanna do is listen she's like
Let's [?]
But I did have a super power though
I could turn into invisible kid
Dissapear out of sight, like a true magician
And one day uncle Ronney
brought over this new, but different
Music into the picture and it become my new religion
""I remember clearly, even today""
Move back to Michigan again
chillin' with my Grandma [? Ned]
Always itchin' for something to do. Was flipping
Through the radio stations one day
And discovered this DJ who was mixing
I say it to this day, if you ain't listened to the the wizard
You ain't have a fucking clue what you was missing
I'd zone out with my headphones
all I remember doing's wishing
For shoes, fuck them stupid [?] bitch
it's all about them new edition [?]
You get them hella Cool J [?]
Think I finally maneuvered to 8 Mile and [? Hoover]
and somehow I found my future is in this
That's how I know my mission
Little boom box [?] and spitting
Practicing numerous rhythms
When I sit in my room envisioning
my dreams come true for wishin'
I remember Proof would visit
Couldn't wait to play him my new shit
he'd go complete ballistic
Go through the roof for his shit
It's like we knew the instant
We tossed a mic that both of us existed to do this shit
Never quid, too persistent
Started a group of misfits
Proof had a proposition
If we all brand together, there ain't no stopping this shit
Come up with alliases, bipolar opposites and
Be ready to come off the top [?]
If you got dissed at the [?] cos if they caught you slippin'
They'd take your spot if someone got to rippin you
And you forgot your written
I fucking got that bitch in a headlock
Cut off his oxygen Slim
[?]
I'm in a league Muhammad's in
All these [?] bombing them
Probably end up on top of them
Stomping them like [?]
Flow vomits in your face
Competitors fall at my waist
You spit a rhyme, I spit in a rhyme's face
So name the time, place to battle
Bitch I'm still in that mind state
Don't make me step on you and make you wine grapes
Cry babies, maybe my way that I use words is loose
But you turds better be careful how you choose yours
[?] but egos bruise worse
And the truth hurts, shit no wonder you're sore losers
Ooh, no more trippin in bird shit
this songs a self empowerment surgeon
Words of encouragement but this [?]
The rap games God
but the name's not James Todd? I'm just a wordsmith
So let these words lift
Cos all I got is bars for you dumbbells and doors
ain't working out
Each verse is more [?] than the first
And you ain't got to wear no shoes
and shirt in this beast? to get served
They shall not escape

Beautiful Pain ,The Marshall Mathers LP 2,2013,"[Eminem and Sia]
I can feel the heat rising
Everything is on fire
Today is a painful reminder of why
We can only get brighter
The further you put it behind ya
And right now I'm on the inside
Lookin' out, 'cause
[Sia]
Standing in the flames
There's a beautiful kind of pain
Setting fire to yesterday
Find the light, find the light, find the light
I found her in the flames
There's a beautiful kind of pain
Setting fire to yesterday
Find the light, find the light, find the light
[Eminem]
Yesterday was the tornado warning
Today is like the morning after
Your world is torn in half, you wake
And let's wait to start the morning process
Rebuilding and you're still a work in progress
Today is a whole new chapter, it's like an enormous ass
The thunderstorm has passed ya
Your weather didn't poke his eyes out
With the thorn bush that you
Used to smell the roses, stopped to inhale
Can't even tell your nose is stuffed
So focused on the brightside, then you floor
The gas pedal, and hit the corner fast
The more asserted, never looking back
May hit the curb
But everyday is a new learning curve
As you, steer through life
Sometimes you might not wanna swerve
But you have to, to avert a disaster
Lucky, no permanent damage
'Cause they hurt you so bad
It's like they murdered your ass
And threw dirt on your casket
But you returned from the ashes
And that hurt that you have, you just converted to gasoline
And while you're burning the past
Standing at inferno and chant
Standing in the flames
There's a beautiful kind of pain
Setting fire to yesterday
Find the light, find the light, find the light
Standing in the flames
There's a beautiful kind of pain
Setting fire to yesterday
Find the light, find the light, find the light
So familiarize
With what having to swallow this pill is like
It happens all the time, they take your heart
And steal your life
And it's as though you feel you've died
Because you've been killed inside
But yet you're still alive which means
You must survive
Although today you may weep because you're weak and
Everything seems so bleak and hopeless
The light that you're seeking, it begins to seep in
That's the only thing keepin' you
From leapin' off the motherfreaking deep in
And I'm pulling for you to push through this feeling
And with a little time that should do the healin'
And by tomorrow you may even feel so good
That you're willing
To forgive them even after
All that shit you been put through
This feeling of resilience is building
And the flames are burning
Quick as fire would through this building
You're sealed in
But your fireproof and retardant you withstood it
And as you climb up to the roof
You're just chillin' and you look down
'Cause you're so over them you could
Put the heel of your foot through the ceilin
As time passes, things change everyday
But wounds? Wounds heal
But scars still remaining the same
But tomorrow today's goin' down in flames
Throw the match at the passed up place
So feel the fire beneath your feet
As you barely even perspire from the heat
Exhale deep and breathe a sigh of relief
And as you say goodbye to the grief
It's like watching the walls melt
In your prison cell
But you've extinguished this living hell
Still a little piece of you dies, you scream
Standing in the flames
There's a beautiful kind of pain
Setting fire to yesterday
Find the light, find the light, find the light
Standing in the flames
There's a beautiful kind of pain
Setting fire to yesterday
Find the light, find the light, find the light
I feel the burn, watch the smoke as I turn rising
A phoenix from the flames
Flame of love, we're going to fight the word, fight
Now it feels with these wings that I will fly
Standing in the flames
There's a beautiful kind of pain
Setting fire to yesterday
Find the light, find the light, find the light
Standing in the flames
There's a beautiful kind of pain
Setting fire to yesterday
Find the light, find the light, find the light"
Wicked Ways ,The Marshall Mathers LP 2,2013,"I'm getting by with my wicked ways

I wanna dig my way to hell
I'm getting by with my wicked ways
I'm loading up and I'm taking names
I wanna dig my way to hell
I wanna dig my way to hell
Guess I got a way with words
I could get away with murder
Ever heard of Aspergers'?
It's a rare condition
It's what you're sufferin' from
When you simply don't care if it's an 80 degree day
And there's no frickin' air conditionin'
And you can't see the bitch's hair is frizzin'
'Cause you got the windows up
Blarin' the system
In your Chevrolet Prizm
The devil ain't on a level same as him
Picture someone who revels in straight masochism
And imagine him givin' an adjective an ass-whoopin'
So bad they should put his ass in prison
A word bully, I verbally abuse verbs
Like they did somethin' to me personally
Used to get bullied, so I'd cut class and ditch it
Now I bully rap, I'm the shit, faggot (Sniff it!)
Cadillac from a K Car
My ass from a hole in the ground
Still can't tell 'em a-part
Came straight out the trailer park
Screamin', ""I'm proud to shop at K-Mart,""
And it became art
And I'm still fed up
And as pissed off as they are
To this day I still get in fights
With the same broad
At the same Walmart
Arguin' over the same cart
In the middle of the aisle whilin'
I don't give a fuck, I don't play
Bitch, you think you saw this basket first?
You're ass backwards
like motherfuckin' Bob and Silent Jay
Illest shit you could think I would say
Mind's like a pile of clay
When's the last time that you saw a villain with a cape
Ripped a gapin' hole in it, flipped out
Ripped down the drapes, tied 'em around my neck
Went down the fire escape of the Empire State
Slipped, fell straight down to the ground
Splattered all over the entire state
And straight to hell, got impaled by the gates
Saw Satan, stuck his face in an ashtray
While I sashayed around flames with a match
And I gave him the gas face
And this ain't got nothin' to do with a scale
Or being gay, little faggot, but by the way
Thoughts are gettin' darker by the day
I'm a combination of Skylar Grey
Tyler the Creator, and Violent J
It's a fuckin' miracle to be this lyrical
Paint my face with clown makeup
and a smiley face
I'm insane, every rhyme I say
Sons you like an ultra-violet ray
I'm sellin' hatred, buffet style
all the shit you can eat
$11.99, so come on and pile a plate!
I'm throwin' down the gauntlet
to see what hell I can raise
With the rhyme I'm spittin'

I've been a career asshole
I don't see why these people always got my back
I done said so much fucked up shit
I was born a mistake
but I was put here not by accident
I had a purpose and that purpose
Was to beat a beat purplish, slaughter tracks
I done put my two dimes
and a nickel in this shit
I'm comin' to get that quarter back
Like Ndamukong, the drama can build
Your mama can ask me for my autograph
'Cause that cougar's a Milf
She's the oldest trick in the book
but I sure would fall for that
You done brought a bat to a rocket launcher fight
When I get on the mic I'ma snap
Make you wish the ambulance that took me to the hospital
When I overdosed woulda caught a flat
If it makes you sick to your stomach acid
Indigestion, my suggestion's Kaopectate
If it feels like I'm runnin' away with the game
It's 'cause I am, don't speculate, spectate
All I got is dick for days
and insults for decades
But I get by with my wicked ways
Lady, you can suck a dick 'til your neck aches
Cry 'til you get puffy eyes, red faced
But I'm leavin' on this jet plane
You ain't fly, you're an airhead
And I'm sick of poundin' a square peg in a round hole
Sorry, another catchphrase
But your baggage ain't gon' fit
in my storage overhead space
'Cause it just ain't big enough
to fit your damaged goods
Other words: don't try to put your heart in a headcase
'Cause baby, stable mentally I ain't
I need my meds, I peed my bed
I'm going blind, I don't see my legs, I keep on falling down
No wonder you can't stand me, I need my cane
Someone help me, I think my face is melting
If you felt these migraines
And see these maggots eat my brain
This G-I-A-N-T hole in my empty head
If you read my mind, you can see my pain
And you'd see why I be this way
Ever since I was knee-high playin' with G.I. Joes
Told these hoes shut their P-I-E holes
now peep my game
'Cause I'm 'bout it 'bout it
Like a fuckin' (fuckin') echo (echo)
(Psych) Psycho on a cyclone cycle
spiralin', here I go
I'm outta control like no other mic go
Stab you 'til the knife goes - dull
I'm nothin' but a hole inside your skull
where your eye goes
'Cause I'ma sock it to you!
Dyke ho, you don't like it?
Get on your Harley Davidson menstrual cycle
And ride it like a motorbike
I'm finna blow the mic the whole night, so
Strike up the fuckin' maestro, I'm nitro
And hi, ho, hand me my shovel!
I'm liable to dig my hole deeper
And it's off to H-E double hockey sticks, I go
I'm getting by with my wicked ways
I'm loading up and I'm taking names
I wanna dig my way to hell
I wanna dig my way to hell
I'm getting by with my wicked ways

I wanna dig my way to hell

Ohh, please be empty
Please be empty, please be empty
Thank you, God!
Shit... Is that a girl?
I'm gonna rock this blouse and put a cock in my mouth
And get my balls blew out, and get gay into the A.M.
And lay with eighteen guys naked
And let myself show, let myself show
Buttfuck it, suck it, pull it, tug it
Life's too short to not stroke your bone
So everybody, everybody
Circle jerk, touch my body
Who is that? Where are you going? Come back!
Why does everyone always leave me?
Hello? Fuck you then!
Blow it out your ass!"
Cold Wind Blows,Recovery,2010,"(Intro)
Cause some things just don't change
It's better when they stay the same
Althought the whole world knows your name
So on the biggest days they came to see you spit your game
Ooooohhhhhhh
It shouldn't be difficult to explain
Just why you came back again, you hate the fame
Love the game, cold as ice you remain
Fuck em' all, tell 'em all eat shit, here we go again
So, god damn... is it that time again already
Haha, you don't look too happy to see me
Fuck man, don't everybody welcome me back at once
All right, fuck ya'll then

Shawty dance while I diss you to the beat, fuck the words
You don't listen to 'em anyway, yeah struck a nerve sucker
Motherfucker might aswell let my lips pucker
Like Elton John, cause I'm just a mean cock sucker
This shit is on, cause you wen't and pissed me off
Now I'm sitting and pissing on everbody

So buck the buddah, light a bong
But take a look at mariah the next time I inspire you to write a song, cmon

Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh, I'm as cold as the cold wind blows
When it snows and it's twenty be-low
Ask me why man I just don't know know know know know know know

Oh oh oh oh oh

Fuck it I'm a loose cannon, Bruce Banner's back in the booth
Ya'll are sitting ducks, I'm the only goose standing
I set the world on fire, piss on it, put it out
Stick my dick in a circle, but I'm not fucking around motherfucker
I'll show you pussy footin, I'll kick a bitch in the cunt
Til it makes her queef and sounds like a fucking whoopy cushion
Who the fuck is you pushin', you musta mistook me for some sissy
Soft punk looking for some nookie or boosom
Go ahead, fucking hater push me
I told you ain't no fucking way to shush me
Call me a faggot cause I hate a pussy
Man the fuck up sissy, G's up
All you gardeners freeze up, put your hoes down (shady ease up!)
Man chill, nah I can't god damnit
Rappers are land fill, drop the anvil
These are shoes that you can't fill
Shit the day that happens the world'll stop spinning
And Michael J. Fox'll come to a stand still
During an earthquake, urine in your face
Cause you're fake, ahh what the fuck, that hurt wait!
Ahh what the fuck, I just got struck by lightening
Alright then I quit, god I give up
Call it evil that men do, lord forgive me for what my pen do
This is for your sins, I cleanse you
You can repent but I warn you, if you continue
To hell I'll send you, and just then the wind blew and I said
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh, I'm as cold as the cold wind blows
When it snows and it's twenty be-low
Ask me why man I just don't know know know know know know know
I'm as cold as the cold wind blows blo-blo-blo-blo-blo-blows
Oh oh oh oh oh
(Verse 3)
How long will I be this way? Shady until my dying day
til I hang up the mic and it's time for me to say
So long, til then i drop the fucking bombs
Like i miss the pass when I went long
If you don't like it you can kiss my ass in a lint thong
Now sing along, slut this, slut that, learn the words to the song
Oh bitches don't like that, homie I'll be nicer to women
When the aqua man drowns and the human torch starts swimming
Man I'm a cold soul, I roll solo so
So don't compare me to them other bums over there
It's like apples to oranges, peaches to plums yeah
I'm bananas pussy, cut off the grapes and grow a pair
But I swear, you try to diss me, I'll slaughter you
I put that on everything, like everyone does with auto-tune
That last thing you wanna do is have me spit out a rhyme
And say I was writing this and I thought of you so
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh, I'm as cold as the cold wind blows
When it snows and it's twenty be-low
Ask me why man I just don't know know know know know know know
I'm as cold as the cold wind blows blo-blo-blo-blo-blo-blo-blows
Oh oh oh oh oh
(Outro)
Oh oh oh oh oh oh
I don't know, I don't know what caused, I don't know what caused me to be this wayme to be this way
I don't know, I don't know by I probably be this way til my dying day
I don't know why I'm so, I'm so cold beat bangs, I don't need to say
I guess this is how you made me"
Talkin' 2 Myself ,Recovery,2010,"(Intro)
Ayo, before I start this song man,
I just wanna thank everyone for being so patient
And bearing with me over the last couple years while
I figure this shit out
(Hook)
Is anybody out there,
It feels like I'm talking to myself
No one seems to know my struggle,
And everything I come from
Can anybody hear me yeah,
I guess I keep talking to myself
Feels like I'm going insane,
Am I the one who's crazy
So why in the world do
I feel so alone
Nobody but me, I'm on my own
Is there anyone out there,
Who feels the way I feel
That there is and let me know so
I know that I'm not the only one
(Verse 1)
I went away I guess that opened up some lanes
But there was no one who even knew
I was going through growing pains
Hatred was flowing through my veins,
on the verge of going insane
I almost made a song dissing Lil Wayne
It's like I was jealous of him,
cause of the attention he was getting
I felt horrible about myself,
he was spitting and I wasn't
Anyone who was buzzing back then could of got it
Almost went at Kanye too,
God it feels like I'm going psychotic
Thank god that I didn't do it
I'd of had my ass handed to me, and I knew it
But proof isn't here
to see me through it
I'm in the booth popping another pill, tryna talk
myself into it
Are you stupid? You gon' start dissing people
for no reason
Especially when you can't
even write a decent punchline even
You're lying to yourself, you're slowing dying
You're denying,
your health is declining with your self esteem
You're crying out for help
(Hook)
Is anybody out there,
It feels like I'm talking to myself
No one seems to know my struggle,
And everything I come from
Can anybody hear me yeah,
I guess I keep talking to myself
Feels like I'm going insane,
Am I the one who's crazy
So why in the world do I feel so alone
Nobody but me, I'm on my own
Is there anyone out there,
Who feels the way I feel
That there is and let me know so
I know that I'm not the only one
(Verse 2)
Marshall, you're no longer the man,
that's a bitter pill to swallow
All I know is I'm wallowing,
self-loathing and hollow
Bottoms up on the pill bottle,
maybe I hit my bottom tomorrow
My sorrow echos in this hall though
But I must be talking to the wall though,
I don't see nobody else
(I guess I keep talking to myself)
But all these other rappers suck
is all that I know
I've turned into a hater, I put up a false mavado
But Marshall is not an egomaniac,
that's not his motto
He's not a desperado, he's desperate,
his thoughts are bottled
Inside him, one foot on the brake,
one of the throttle
Falling asleep with writers block
in the parking lot of Mcdonalds
But instead of feeling sorry for yourself,
do something about it
Admit you got a problem, your brain is clouded
You're powdered long enough,
It isn't them, it's you, you fucking baby
Quit worrying bout what they do and do
Shady, I'm fucking going crazy
(Hook)
Is anybody out there,
It feels like I'm talking to myself
No one seems to know my struggle,
And everything I come from
Can anybody hear me yeah,
I guess I keep talking to myself
Feels like I'm going insane,
Am I the one who's crazy
So why in the world do I feel so alone
Nobody but me, I'm on my own
Is there anyone out there,
Who feels the way I feel
That there is and let me know so
I know that I'm not the only one
(Verse 3)
So I picked myself up off the ground,
and fucking swam before I drowned
Hit my bottom so hard I bounced twice,
advice this time around
It's different, them last 2 albums didn't count
Encore I was on drugs,
Relapse I was flushing 'em out
I've come to make it up to you,
now no more fucking around
I got something to prove to fans cause
I feel like I let 'em down
So please accept my apology,
I finally feel like I'm back to normal
I feel like me again,
let me formally re-introduce myself
To you for those of you who don't know
The new me's back to the old me,
and homie I don't show no
Signs of slowing or bowing,
I'm blowing up all over
My life is no longer a movie,
but the show ain't over homos
I'm back with a vengeance homie,
Weezy keep your head up
T.I. keep your head up, Kanye keep your head up
Don't let up, just keep slaying em
Rest in peace to Dj Am,
cause I know what this shit is like
I struggle with this shit every single day and I'm
(Hook)
Is anybody out there,
It feels like I'm talking to myself
No one seems to know my struggle,
And everything I come from
Can anybody hear me yeah,
I guess I keep talking to myself
Feels like I'm going insane,
Am I the one who's crazy
So why in the world do I feel so alone
Nobody but me, I'm on my own
Is there anyone out there,
Who feels the way I feel
That there is and let me know so
I know that I'm not the only one
(Outro)
So there it is, damn,
feels like I just woke up or something
Guess I just forgot who the fuck I was man
Ayo, and to anybody I thought about going at,
it was never nothing personal
Just some shit that I was going through
And to the rest of you, I'm back!"
On Fire,Recovery,2010,"Yeah, ya know? Critics man
Critics never got nothin' nice to say, man
You know the one thing I notice about critics, man?
Is critics never ask me how my day went
Well, I'mma tell 'em
Yesterday my dog died, I hog tied a ho, tied her in a bow
Said next time you blow up try to spit a flow
You wanna criticize dog try a little mo'
I'm so tired of this I could blow, fire in the hole
I'm fired up so fire up the lighter and the 'dro
Better hold on a little tighter here I go
Flows tighter, hot headed as ghost rider
Cold hearted as spiderman throwin' a spider in the snow
So ya better get to blowin in flow rider
Inside of a low rider with no tires in the hole
Why am I like this? Why is winter cold?
Why is it when I talk, I'm so biased to the hoes?
Listen dog, Christmas is off, this is as soft as it gets
This isn't gob this is a blister in the salt
Those are your wounds this is the salt, so get lost
Shit dissin' me is just like pissin' off the wizard of oz
Wrap a lizard in gauze, beat you in the jaws with it
Grab the scissors and saws
And cut out your livers gizzards and balls
Throw you in the middle of the ocean in the blizzard with jaws
So sip piss like sizzurp through a straw
Then describe how it tasted like dessert to us all
Got the gall to make Chris piss in his draws
Ticklin' him go to his grave, skip him and visit his dog
You're on fire
That's how ya know your on a roll
'Cause when you hot it's like your burnin' up everyone else's cold
Your on fire
Man, I'm so fuckin' sick, I got ambulances pullin' me over and shit
You're on fire
Ya need to stop drop and roll 'cause when you say the shit
To give the whole hip hop shop the blow
You're on fire, yeah, you're on fire
I just wrote a bullshit hook in between two long ass verses
If you mistook the for a song, look
This ain't a song it's a warnin' to Brooke Hogan and David Cook
That the crook just took over so book
Run as fast as you can, stop writin' and kill it
I'm lightning in a skillet, your a fuckin' flash in a pan
I pop up you bitches scatter like hot grease splashin' a fan
Mr Mathers is the man
Yeah, I'm pissed but I would rather take this energy
And stash it in a can, come back and whip your ass with it again
Salivas like sulfuric acid in your hand it'll eat through
Anything metal the ass of iron man
Turn him into plastic so for you to think
That you could stand a fuckin' chance is assanine
Yeah, ask the nine man, hit a blind man with a coloring book
And told him color inside the lines or get hit widda fine crayon
Fuck it I ain't playin', pull up in a van and hop out
At a homeless man holdin' a sign sayin'
Vietnam vet, I'm out my fuckin' mind, man
Kick over the can beat his ass and leave him 9 grand
So if I seem a little mean to you
This ain't savage you ain't never seen the brew
You wanna get graphic we can go the scenic route
You couldn't make a belemic puke
On a piece of fuckin' corn and peanut boo
Sayin' you sick, quit playin' you prick don't nobody care
Then why the fuck am I yellin' at air
I ain't even talkin' to no one 'cause ain't nobody there
Nobody will fuckin' test me 'cause these hos won't even dare
I'm wastin' punchlines but I got so many to spare
I just thought of another one that might go here
Naw, don't waste it save it, psycho, yeah
Plus you gotta rewrite those lines that you said about Michael's hair
You're on fire
That's how ya know your on a roll
'Cause when you hot it's like your burnin' up everyone else's cold
You're on fire
Man, I'm so hot my motherfuckin' firetrucks on fire, homie
You're on fire
Ya need to stop drop and roll 'cause when you say the shit
To give the whole hip hop shop the blow
You're on fire, yeah, your on fire
You're on fire"
Won't Back Down ,Recovery,2010,"(Hook)
You can sound the alarm, you can call out your guards
You can fence in your yard, you can pull all the cards
But I won't back down, oh no I won't back down, oh no
(Verse 1)
Cadillacs Sevilles, Coupe Deville's
Brain dead rims, yeah stupid wheels
Girl I'm too for real, lose your tooth and nails
Try to fight it, try to deny it, stupid you will feel
What I do, I do it well
Shooting from the hip, yeah boy I shoot to kill
Half a breath left on my death bed
Screaming F that, yeah super ill
Baby what the deal, we can chill
Split a half a pill and a happy meal
Fuck a steak slut, I'll cut my toes off
And step on the receipt before I foot the bill
Listen garden tool, don't make me introduce you to my power tool
You know the fucking drill
How you douche bags feel knowing you're disposable?
Summer's eve massingale
Shady's got the mass appeal, baby crank the shit
Cause it's your god damned jam
You said that you want your punclines a little more compact
Well shorty I'm that man
These other cats ain't metaphorically where I'm at man
I gave Bruce Wayne a valium
And said settle your fucking ass down, I'm ready for combat man
Get it, calm Batman? Nah, ain't nobody who's as bomb and as
Nuts, lines are like mom's cat scans
Cause they fucking go ba-na-nas
Honey I applaude that ass, swear to god man
These mobs can't dance, maa show 'em how it's done
Spaz like a god damn Taz, yeah
(Hook)
You can sound the alarm, you can call out your guards
You can fence in your yard, you can pull all the cards
But I won't back down, oh no I won't back down, oh no
(Verse 2)
Girl shake that ass like a donkey with parkinsons
Make like Michael J Fox in the jaws playing with an etcha-sketch
Bet ya that you'll never guess who's knockin' at your doors
People's hit the floors, yeah tonight ladies you gon' get divorced
Girl forget remorse, Imma hit you broads with
Chris' force like you pissed him off
Talented with the tongue motherucker, you ain't got a lick in yours
Hittin' licks, like I'm robbin' liquor stores
Making cash registers shit their drawers
Think you spit the rawest?
I'm an uncooked slab of beef laying on your kitchen floor
Otherwords, I'm off the meat rack, bring the beat back
Bring it to extension cords
Imma measure my dick, shit I need six inches more
Fuck my dick's big bitch, need I remind you
That I don't need the fucking swine flu to be a sick pig
You're addicted, I'm dope, I'm the longest needle around here
Need a fix oc? I'm the big shot, get it dick snots?
You're just small boats, little pricks
Girl you think that other prick's hot?
I'll drink gasoline and eat a lit match
Before I sit back and let him get hot
Better call the cops on him quick fast
Shady'd right back on your bitch ass
White trash with a half a six pack in his hatchback
Trailer hitch at-tached to the back, dispatch
(Hook)
You can sound the alarm, you can call out your guards
You can fence in your yard, you can pull all the cards
But I won't back down, oh no I won't back down, oh no
(Verse 3)
Bitch am I the reason that your boyfriend stopped rappin'
Does a bird chirp, Lil' Wayne slurps syrup til he burps
And smokes purp, does a wordsearch get circles wrapped around it
like you do when I come through, I'd like you to remind yourself
Of what the fuck I can do when I'm on the mic
Oh you're the kinda girl I can take a liking to
Psych I'm spiking you, like a football
Been this way since I stood a foot tall
You're a good catch, with a shitty spouse
Got a pretty mouth and a good jaw
Gimmie good brain, watch the woodgrain
Don't want no cum-stain, bitch you listening?
Try to turn me down, slut I'm talking to you
Turn me back up, are you insane
Try to talk over me in the car, shut the fuck up while my shit's playing
I'm a shit stain on the underwear of life
What's the saying? when there's thunder then there's light-ening
And they say that it never strikes twice in the same place
Then how the fuck have I been hit six times
On three different locations on four seperate occasions?
And you can bet your stinking ass
That I've come to smash everything in my path
Folk was in the road, took the psychopath
Poison Ivy wouldn't have me thinking rash
So hit the dancefloor cutie, while I do my duty
On this microphone, shake your booty shorty
I'm the shit, why you think Proof used to call me doodie?
(Hook)
You can sound the alarm, you can call out your guards
You can fence in your yard, you can pull all the cards
But I won't back down, oh no I won't back down, oh no"
W.t.p. (white Trash Party),Recovery,2010,"(Intro)
Yeah... Oh.... get up, I said get up... let's go
Better watch out now cause here we come
And we ain't stoppin' until we see the morning sun
So give us room to do our thing, cause we ain't come to hurt no one
So everybody come and get upon the floor now and grab someone
(Verse 1)
Man first of all, I'm a boss, I just wanna get that across
Man even my dentist hates when I floss
Pull up to the club in a Pinto like it's a Porche
Garbage bag for one of the windows, spray painted doors
With the flames on 'em, Michigan plates and my names on 'em
Baby Shady's here, come and get him if you dames want him
But he ain't stupid so quit tryna run them games on him
He's immune to cupid, why you tryna put your claims on him
Cause you won't do to me what you did to the last man
Now climb it back, try not to kick over the gas can
There's a half a gallon in it, that could be our last chance
We have of just getting home, now can I get that lap dance?
She's got a tattoo of me right above her ass man
In the streets of Warren, Michigan we call 'em tramp stamps
That means she belongs to me, time to put the damn clamps
Down and show this hussie who's man, now get amped, dance!
(Hook)
Now you can do this on your own, but everyone knows
That no one likes to be alone, so get on the floor and grab somebody
Ain't nothing but a white trash party!
So let's have us a little bash, and if anyone asks
It ain't no one, but us trash
You don't know, you better ask somebody
Cause we're having a white trash party!
(Verse 2)
Pull up at the bacardi from outta my underwear
And walk around the party without a care, like a body without a head
Looking like a zombie from outta the Living Dead
And tomorrow probably still be too high to get out of bed
Til I feel like I been hit with the sharp part of the hammer
Mixing hennessey and fanta with Pepto and Mylanta
I shoot the gift like I'm hollerin' ""die santa""
Missed the tree and hit Rudolf and two innocent bystanders
So quite tryna play the wall like you Paul
And get on the floor when the beat drops and stop stallin'
They call the Stefan Marlbury of rap, darling
Cause soon as they throw on some R. Kelly I start ballin'!
Making it rain for the ladies in the mini's
But I'm not throwing ones, five's, ten's or even twenty's
I'm throwing quarters, nickels, dimes, pennys
Up at skinny's, man I do this for them bunnys up at Denny's
From the north east and west
But when it comes to them trailers in them south parks, muffle it
Cause homie, that hood's tighter than Kenny's
So ladies if your belly button's not an innie, them I'm outtie
Now hop in my minivan, let's get rowdy cmon!
(Hook)
Now you can do this on your own, but everyone knows
That no one likes to be alone, so get on the floor and grab somebody
Ain't nothing but a white trash party!
So let's have us a little bash, and if anyone asks
It ain't no one, but us trash
You don't know, you better ask somebody
Cause we're having a white trash party!
(Bridge)
Now whether you're black, white or purple if you're misunderstood
But you don't give a fuck, you ain't doing shit that you should
Long as you know you're up to evil and you're no damn good
Get on the floor mayne, and rep your hood
(Verse 3)
Now honey, don't let them pricks trick
We should make a quick dip
And go do some doughnuts in the hospital parking lot
Cause girl I got a sick whip, kick the back window outta my gremlin
Put two milk crates in the trunk, rip out the stick shift
And make a five seater, I'll be damned if I feed a
Chick, it ain't like me to split a peice of dry pita
I'll beat an S until the I M to the S-H-ady
Why I don't need a tank top to be a wife beater
I'll rip a tree out the ground and flip it upside down
'for I turn over a new leaf clown, I'll tell you now
I'm so raw I still need to unthaw, you feel me ya'll
I shut the club down, like Drake in the mall!
But baby a body like that's against the law
You the baddest little chain with the blades I ever saw
Coleslaw containers, empty straw rappers and all
You got more junk in your trunk than I do in my car, now get up!
(Hook)
Now you can do this on your own, but everyone knows
That no one likes to be alone, so get on the floor and grab somebody
Ain't nothing but a white trash party!
So let's have us a little bash, and if anyone asks
It ain't no one, but us trash

Going Through Changes,Recovery,2010,"(hook)
I'm going through changes
I'm going through changes
(verse 1)
Lately, I really feel like I'm rolling for delph like philly
Feel like I'm losing control of myself
I sincerely Apologize if all that I sound like
Is I am complaining
But life keeps on complicating
And I'm debating on leaving this world this evening
Even my girls can see I'm grieving
I try and hide it, but I can't
Why do I act like I'm all high and mighty
When inside I'm dying
I am finally realizing, I need help
Can't do it myself, too weak
Two weeks I've been having ups and downs, going
Through peaks and valleys
Dilly-dallying 'round with the idea of ending this Shit right here
I'm hating my reflection, I walk around the house
Tryin' to fight mirrors
I can? t stand what I look like, here, I look fat
But what do I care? I could give a fuck
Only thing I fear is hailie
I'm afraid if I close my eyes then I might see her, shit
(hook)
I'm going through changes
I'm going through changes
(verse 2)
I lock myself in the bedroom, bathroom, napping at noon
Yeah, dad's in a bad mood
he's always snapping at you
Marshall what happened that you
can't stop with these pills
And you've fallen off with your skills
And your own fans are laughing at you
You've become a problem you're too pussy to tackle
Get up, be a man, stand
A real man would of had this shit handled
Know you just had your heart ripped out and crushed
They say proof just flipped out
Homie just whipped out and bust, nah
It isn't like dudey to do that, he wouldn't fuckin
Shoot at nobody, he'd fight first
But dwelling on it only makes the night worse
Now I'm popping vics, percs and methadone pills
""yeah em, tight verse, you killed it""
Fuckin' drug dealers hang around me like yes-men
And they gonna do whatever I says when, I says it
It's in their best interest to protect their investment
And I just lost my fucking best friend, so fuck it I guess then
(hook)
I'm going through changes
I'm going through changes
Don't know what I'm gonna do
But I just keep on going through changes
(verse 3)
My friends can't understand this new me, that's
Understandable, man
But think how bananas
you'd be, you'd be an animal too
If you were trapped in this fame and caged in it like a zoo
And everybody's lookin? at you
what you want me to do?
I'm starting to live like a recluse and the truth is
Fame is starting to give me an excuse
to be at a all time low
I sit alone in my home theater
Watching the same damn dvd of the first tour
The last tour, he was still alive and it hurts
So I fast forward
sleeping pills will make me feel alright
And if I'm still awake in the middle of the night
I just take a couple more, yeah
you're motherfucking right
I ain't slowing down for no one
I am almost homeward bound
Almost in a coma, yeah homie
come on dole 'em out
""daddy don't you die on me
Daddy better hold your ground! ""
Fuck, don't I know the sound of that voice
Yeah baby, hold me down
(hook)
I'm going through changes
I'm going through changes
Don't know what I'm gonna do
But I just keep on going through changes
(verse 4)
Wake up in the hospital full of tubes
Plus somehow I'm pulling through
Swear when I come back I'ma be bulletproof
I'mma do it just for proof
I think I should state a few facts
'cause I may not get a chance again to say the truth
Shit it just hit me that what if
I would not have made it through
I think about the things
I would have never got to say to you
I'd never get to make it right
so here's what I came to do
Hailie this one is just for you, whitney and elaina too
I still love your mother, that will never change
Think about her every day
We just could never get it together
Hey, wish there was a better way for me to say it
But I swear on everything
I'll do anything for her on any day
There are just too many things to explain
When it rains, guess it pours
Yes it does, wish there wasn't any pain
But I can't pretend there ain't
I ain't placing any blame, I ain't pointing fingers
Heaven knows I never been a saint
I know that it feels like we just pissed away our History
and just today I looked at your picture, almost hate to say
I miss you, sub-consciously
Wish it didn't end this way, but I just had to get Away
Don't know why, I don't know what else to say, I guess I'm
(hook)
I'm going through changes
Don't know what I'm gonna do
But I just keep on going through changes
I'm going through changes"
Not Afraid,Recovery,2010,"(Chorus)
I'm not afraid to take a stand
Everybody come take my hand
We'll walk this road together, through the storm
Whatever weather, cold or warm
Just let me know that, you're not alone
Holla if you feel like you've been down the same road
Yeah, It's been a ride...
I guess I had to go to that place to get to this one
Now some of you might still be in that place
If you're trying to get out, just follow me
I'll get you there
You can try and read my lyrics off of this paper
Before I lay em
But you won't take this thing out these words
before I say em
Cause ain't no way I'm let you stop me
from causing mayhem
When I say em or do something
I do it, I don't give a damn
What you think?
I'm doing this for me, so fuck the world
Feed it beans, it's gassed up,
If a thing's stopping me
I'mma be what I set out to be,
Without a doubt undoubtedly
And all those who look down on me
I'm tearing down your balcony
No if ands or buts
Don't try to ask him why or how can he
From Infinite down to the last
Relapse album he's still shit and
Whether he's on salary, paid hourly
Until he bows out or he shits his bowels out of him
Whichever comes first, for better or worse
He's married to the game,
Like a fuck you for christmas
His gift is a curse,
Forget the earth he's got the urge
To pull his dick from the dirt and fuck the whole universe
(Chorus)
I'm not afraid to take a stand
Everybody come take my hand
We'll walk this road together, through the storm
Whatever weather, cold or warm
Just let me know that, you're not alone
Holla if you feel like you've been down the same road
Ok quit playin' with the scissors and shit,
And cut the crap
I shouldn't have to rhyme these words
In the rhythm for you to know it's a rap
You said you was king, you lied through your teeth
For that fuck your feelings,
Instead of getting crowned you're getting capped
And to the fans, I'll never let you down again,
I'm back
I promise to never go back on that promise, in fact
Let's be honest, that last Relapse Cd was ""ehhhh""
Perhaps I ran them accents into the ground
Relax, I ain't going back to that now
All I'm tryna say is get back, click-clack Blaow
Cause I ain't playin' around
There's a game called circle and I don't know how
I'm way too up to back down
But I think I'm still tryna figure this crap out
Thought I had it mapped out but I guess I didn't
This fucking black cloud's still follow's me around
But it's time to exorcise these demons
These motherfuckers are doing jumping jacks now!
(Chorus)
I'm not afraid to take a stand
Everybody come take my hand
We'll walk this road together, through the storm
Whatever weather, cold or warm
Just let me know that, you're not alone
Holla if you feel like you've been down the same road
And I just can't keep living this way
So starting today, I'm breaking out of this cage
I'm standing up, Imma face my demons
I'm manning up, Imma hold my ground
I've had enough, now I'm so fed up
Time to put my life back together right now
It was my decision to keep it clean, I did it for me
Admittedly I probably did it subliminally for you
So I could come back a brand new me,
You helped see me through
And don't even realise what you did,
Believe me you
I been through the ringer,
But they can do little to the middle finger
I think I got a tear in my eye,
I feel like the king of..
My world, haters can make
Like bees with no stingers, and drop dead
No more beef flingers, no more drama from now on,
I promise
To focus soley on handling my responsibility's
As a father
So I solemnly swear to
Always treat this roof like my
Daughters and raise it
You couldn't lift a single shingle lonely
Cause the way I feel, I'm strong enough to go to the club
Or a corner pub and lift the whole liquor counter up
Cause I'm raising the bar, I shoot for the moon
But I'm too busy gazing at stars, I feel amazing and I'm not
(Chorus)
I'm not afraid to take a stand
Everybody come take my hand
We'll walk this road together, through the storm
Whatever weather, cold or warm
Just let me know that, you're not alone
Holla if you feel like you've been down the same road"
Seduction,Recovery,2010,"(Intro:)
I don't now man, just feels like, well a lot different
Kinda feels like, I'm on a whole different page right now
Feels strange but um, I guess it's kinda like... it's kinda like
(Verse 1:)
I feel like I'm morphin, into something so incredible, that I'm dwarfin'
All competetors, better get your girlfriend in check
It's psychological warfare, endorphin side-effect
Your self esteem shatters his dialect
Comes blasting out your deck, she loves me
So much passion you'd expect this sort reaction from her yet
You're strong oh, you're fucking corny, you try to turn your charm on
Cause you just think you're Bishop the don one
But if you think you're fucking with me, homie you're on one
I'm cockin' my head back like 'Ed Lover, come on son
She's on my johnson, she brings my name up constant
Your boys are like ""she's fucking with dude, she wants some""
Homeboy, you better get a clue
She's on my dick cause I spit better than you
What you expect her to do? How you expect her to act in the sack
When she's closing her eyes, fantasizing
Of digging her nails in my back to this track
(Hook:)
Seduction, seduce
Ain't nobody who's as good at what I do
Cause one minute she loves you, the next she don't
She's been stolen from you
Seduction, seduce
Ain't nobody who's as good at what I do
Cause one minute she loves you, the next she don't
She's been stolen from you
(Verse 2:)
She's sitting there getting liquored up at the bar
She says it's quicker to count the things that ain't wrong with you
Than to count the things that are
There's a seven disc, CD changer in her car
And I'm in every single slot, and you're not, aw
I'm the logo on that Dallas Cowboy helmet, a star
And I'm not about to sit back and just keep rhyming one syllable, nah
Switch it up and watch them haters not give it up
Cause they're just not good enough
But I'm not giving up til I get my respect
And I won't stop til I get enough
Cause I'm not living up to my own expectations, aw
That hater alarm is sounding off
And Obama took the bomb from my name, aw
So quit crying that I took your dame
Homie she's my dame, aw
You sadly mistaken if you thinkin' that I'm not on my game boy
And things just ain't been the same since the day that I came for it
You wear your heart on your sleeve, I sport that white tank boy
But you got a hard on for me, what you hollerin' my name for?
It's your bitch on my dick, ain't my dang fault
Man I can't call it
(Hook:)
Seduction, seduce
Ain't nobody who's as good at what I do
Cause one minute she loves you, the next she don't
She's been stolen from you
Seduction, seduce
Ain't nobody who's as good at what I do
Cause one minute she loves you, the next she don't
She's been stolen from you
(Verse 3:)
It's like we're playing lyrical tug of war with your ear
You hear it, girl come here, put your ear up to the speaker
Dear, while I freak this world premier
Seducing her, loosen up with a little freestyle
Wait, am I losing ya? Am I making you look bad?
Well I got news for ya homie, you're losing her
Oh wait she don't like when I spit it fast
Am I tryna show how, let me slow it down
It's still gonna be a blowout
You're gonna wanna throw out your whole album
Rummage through the shit and try to salvage something
To see if you can save any of it punk
But none of it's fucking with me
Prick you really feeling that bullshit?
You think you killing them syllables? quit playing
These beats ain't nothing to fool with
They call me fire Marshall, I shut the shit down
Your entire arsenal is not enough to fuck with one round
I am also the opposite of what you are like
You're a microcosm of what the fuck I am on the mic
I am awesome, and you are just awe-struck
She's love-stricken, she's got her jaw stuck
From sucking my dick, awwfuck
(Hook:)
Seduction, seduce
Ain't nobody who's as good at what I do
Cause one minute she loves you, the next she don't
She's been stolen from you
Seduction, seduce
Ain't nobody who's as good at what I do
Cause one minute she loves you, the next she don't
She's been stolen from you"
No Love ,Recovery,2010,"(Verse 1)
Young Money yeah... uh
Throw dirt on me and grow a wildflower
But it's ""fuck the world"", get a child out her
Yeah, my life a bitch, but you know nothing 'bout her
Been to hell and back, I can show you vouchers
I'm rolling sweets, I'm smoking sour
Married to the game but she broke her vows
That's why my bars are full of broken bottles
And my night stands are full of open bibles
I think about more than I forget
But I don't go around fire expecting not to sweat
And these niqqas know I lay them down, make your bed
Bitches try to kick me while I'm down, I'll break your leg
Money outweighing problems on the triple beam
I'm sticking to the script, you niqqas skipping scenes
Be good or be good at it
Fucking right I've got my gun, semi-Cartermatic
Yeah, put the dick in they mouth, so I guess it's ""fuck what they say""
I'm high as a bitch, up, up and away
Man, I come down in a couple of days
Ok, you want me up in the cage, then I'll come out in beast mode
I got this world stuck in the safe, combination is the G-code
It's Weezy motherfucker, blood gang and I'm in bleed mode
All about my dough, but I don't even check the peephole
So you can keep knocking but won't knock me down
No love lost, no love found
(Hook)
It's a little too late to say that you're sorry now
You kicked me when I was down
But what you say just (don't hurt me, it don't hurt me, no more)
Bitch you get (no love)
You show me nothing but hate
You ran me into the ground
But what comes around goes around
And you don't (don't hurt me)
You (don't hurt me no more)
Bitch you get (no love, no love, no love, no love)
Bitch you get (no love, no love, no love)
And I don't need you (no more)
Get em
(Verse 2)
I'm alive again
More alive than I have been in my whole entire life
I can see these people's ears perk up as I begin
To spaz with the pen, I'm a little bit sicker than most
Shit's finna get thick again
They say the competition is stiff
But I get a hard dick from this shit, now stick it in
I ain't never giving in again
Caution to the wind, complete freedom
Look at these rappers, how I treat 'em
So why the fuck would I join 'em when I beat 'em
They call me a freak cause
I like to spit on these pussies fore I eat 'em
Man get these whack cocksuckers off stage
Where the fuck is Kanye when you need him?
Snatch the mic from him, bitch Imma let you finish in a minute
Yeah the rap is tight
But I'm 'bout to spit the greatest verse of all time
So you might want to go back to the lab tonight and um
Scribble out them rhymes you were going to spit
And start over from scratch and write new ones
But I'm afraid that it ain't gonna make no difference
When I rip this stage and tear it in half tonight
It's an adrenaline rush to feel the bass thump
In the place all the way to the parking lot, fellow
Set fire to the mic and ignite the crowd
You can see the sparks from hot metal
Cold-hearted from the day I Bogarted the game
I so started to rock fellow
When I'm not even in my harshest
You can still get roasted because Marsh is not mellow
'Til I'm toppling from the top I'm not going to stop
I'm standing on my Monopoly board
That means I'm on top of my game and it don't stop
'Til my hip don't hop anymore
When you so good that you can't say it
Because it ain't even cool for you to sound cocky anymore
People just get sick cause you spit
These fools can't drool or dribble a drop anymore
And you can never break my stride
You never slow the momentum at any moment I'm about to blow
You'll never take my pride
Killing the flow, slow venom any opponent
Is getting no mercy, mark my words
Ain't letting up, relentless
I smell blood, I don't give a fuck, keep giving 'em hell
Where was you when I fell and needed help up?
You get no love
(Hook)
It's a little too late to say that you're sorry now
You kicked me when I was down
But what you say, just (don't hurt me, it don't hurt me, no more)
Bitch you get (no love)
You show me nothing but hate
You ran me into the ground
But what comes around goes around
And you don't (don't hurt me)
You (don't hurt me no more)
Bitch you get (no love, no love, no love, no love)
Bitch you get (no love, no love, no love)
And I don't need you (no more)
Bitch you get no (love)"
Space Bound,Recovery,2010,"We touch, I feel a rush
We clutch, it isn't much
But it's enough to make me wonder
what's in store for us
It's lust, it's torturous
You must be a sorceress cause you just
Did the impossible
Gain my trust, don't play games it'll be dangerous
If you fuck me over
Cause if I get burnt, I'ma show you what it's
like to hurt
Cause I been treated like dirt before ya
And love is evil
Spell it backwards I'll show ya
Nobody knows me, I'm cold
Walk down this road all alone
It's no one's fault but my own
It's the path I've chosen to go
Frozen as snow, I show no emotion whatsoever so
Don't ask me why,
I have no love for these mufuckin' hoes
Bloodsuckin succubus, what the fuck is up with this
I've tried in this department
but I ain't had no luck with this
It sucks but it's exactly what I thought it would be
Like tryin' to start over
I gotta hole in my heart
I'm some kind of emotional roller-coaster
Somethin' I won't go on
til you toy with my emotion so it's over
It's like an explosion, every time I hold ya
Wasn't jokin' when I told ya
Ya take my breathe away
You're a supernova... and I'm a
I'ma space bound rocket ship and your heart's the moon
And I'm aiming right at you
Right at you
250 thousand miles on a clear night in June
And I'm aiming right at you
Right at you
Right at you
I'll do whatever it takes
When I'm with you, I get the shakes
My body aches when I ain't
With you I have zero strength
There's no limit on how far I would go
No boundaries, no lengths
Why do we say that
until we get that person that we think's
Gonna be that one and then once we get 'em,
it's never the same
You want them when they don't want you
Soon as they do, feelings change
It's not a contest and I ain't on no conquest for no mate
I wasn't looking
but I stumbled onto you, must've been fate
But so much is at stake, what the fuck does it take
Let's cut to the chase
But a door shuts in your face
Promise me if I cave in and break
and leave myself open
That I won't be makin' a mistake, cause I'm a
I'ma space bound rocket ship and your heart's the moon
And I'm aiming right at you
Right at you
250 thousand miles on a clear night in June
And I'm aiming right at you
Right at you
Right at you
So after a year and 6 months
It's no longer me that you want
But I love you so much it hurts
Never mistreated you once
I poured my heart out to you
Let down my guard, swear to god
I'll blow my brains in your lap
Lay here and die in your arms
Drop to my knees and I'm pleading
I'm trying to stop you from leaving
You won't even listen, so fuck it
I'm trying to stop you from breathing
I put both hands on your throat
I sit on top of you, squeezing
Til I snap ya neck like a Popsicle stick
Ain't no possible reason, I could think of
To let you walk up out this house, and let you live
Tears streamed down both of my cheeks
Then I let you go and just give
And before I put that gun to my temple
I told you this
And I would've do anything for you
To show you how much I adored you
But it's over now
It's too late to save our love
Just promise me you'll think of me every time
You look up in the sky and see a star cause I'm a
Space bound rocket ship and your heart's the moon
And I'm aiming right at you
Right at you
250 thousand miles on a clear night in June
And I'm so lost without you
Without you
Without you"
Cinderella Man,Recovery,2010,"(Intro)
Yeah, you know technically, I'm not even really suppose to be here, right now
So fuck it, might as well make the most of it
Feels good! Whooooooo!
Guess I'm lucky, some of us don't get a second chance
But I aint blowing this one... nah man...
Haha, shit I feel like I can do anything now
(Verse 1)
Who could catch lighting in a bottle, set fire to water
Coming out the nozzle on the fire hose, fly out and swat a
(Cinderella man, Cinderella man, Cinderella man, Cinderella man)
Smash an hour glass, grab the sand, take his hands and cuff 'em
Spit around to freeze a clock, take the hands of time and cuff 'em
(Cinderella man, Cinderella Man, Cinderella Man, Cinderella Man)
Theres a storm coming that the weather man couldn't predict
I start to ball prick, you betta flee cause I get ticked
It's a wrap, I was down, when I was down I was kicked
I got up im back to punch you to the ground, you trick, it’s a trap
Fuck my last CD, that shits in my trash
I be goddamn if another rapper gets in my ass
I hit the gas and I spit every rap as if it's my last
You can die in a blink of an eye, so bat your eyelashes
And keep winking and blowing kisses, cause your flirting with death
Im destroying your livelihood, I aint just hurting your rep
I catch a flow and get going otherwise im showing they slowing
For knowing no one is nothing you can do about it
Zero in on my target like a marksman, the target is you
I shut your lane down, took your spot, parked in it too
Arsonic flow, lighter fluid saliva, what can you do?
Go get your crew to hype you up, stand behind you like “woo!”
That boys hot enough to melt hell, burn Satan too
Fry his ass and put his ashes back together with glue
See you can hate him, he don't blame you, frankly he would too
This game could ill afford to lose him, how about you?
Now guess who (hey) here's a clue (hey)
He came to the ball in his wife beater, lost his nike shoe
It's in your ass, he's in your ass he's all up in your psyche, too
Now what’s his name?
(Hook)
Cinda-rella Man, Cinda-ella Man, Cinda-rella, Cinda-rella Man, Cinda-rella Man
(Hey Hey)
If I had a time machine I’d be
Cinderella Man, Cinderella Man, Cinderella Man Cinderella Man
Music is my time machine, so call me
Cinderella Man, Cinderella Man, Cinderella Man, Cinderella Man
(Verse 2)
Fuck catchin lighting, he struck it, screams shut up at thunder
Than flip the world upside down and made it rain upward
(Cinderella Man, Cinderella Man, Cinderella Man, Cinderella Man)
Rewound the future to the present, paused it, don’t ask how
Fuck the past motherfucker he's the shit right now
(Cinderella Man, Cinderella Man, Cinderella Man, Cinderella Man)
Cinderella Man sent a fellow Shady dame, came to wrap the game
Up in cellophane raise hell, from hell he came
But didn't come to bore you with this Cinderella story
Nor did he come to do the same, or can afford to be
A lamo in this day in age, and at this stage in the game
Mediocrity can no longer be allowed to fly, so say bye
To the old HI to the new ca-so-ra
Consider it his last hoorah, the coupe de gra
Raise them high in the sky, keep em up
Time to bring the place alive, thanks for being patient
I will make no more mistakes, shit my potatoes baked homie
The veggies on my plate can fly, my fillet is smoking weed
Get back if the stakes are high
Shit I aint even suppose to be here by the grace of God
The skin on my teeth and the hair on my nuts, I skated by
Now ya'll are on thin ice with ankle weights, I'd hate to lie
How fucking irritated are you, how much in your face am I!
And aint shit you can do, but fear it, Proof is here in spirit
And I'm a spitting image, I mirror it when I stand near it
Your pussy lyric, I cunt hear it
Who forms pyramids and raps circles around square lyricists
Who? (hey) heres a clue (hey)
He came to the ball in his wife beater, lost his nike shoe
It's in your ass, he's in your ass, he's all up in your psyche, too
Now what's his name?

Too late for the other side
Caught in a chase
25 to life
Too late for the other side
Caught in a chase
25 to life
Too late for the other side
Caught in a chase
25 to life
Yeah, I can't keep chasing you
Taking my life back
Caught in a chase
25 to life
(Verse 1)
I dont think she understands the sacrifices that I've made
Maybe if this bitch had acted right, I would've stayed
But I've already wasted over half of my life,
I would've laid
Down and died for you, I no longer cry for you
No more pain bitch you
Took me for granted took my heart
and ran it straight into the planet
Into the dirt, I can no longer stand it
Now my respect, I demand it
Imma take control of this relationship
Command it, and Imma be the boss of you now goddamnit
And what I mean
is that I will no longer let you control me
So you better hear me out this much you owe me
I gave up my life for you,
totally devoted to you while I've stayed
Paved for all the way, this is how I fucking get repaid
Look at how I dress fucking baggy sweats,
go to work a mess
Always in a rush to get back to you,
I ain't heard you yet
Not even once say you appreciate me,
I deserve respect
I've done my best to give you nothing less than perfectness
And I know that if I end this, I'll no longer have nothing left
But you keep treating me like a staircase,
it's time to fucking step
And I won't be coming back,
so don't hold your fucking breath
You know what you've done no need to go in depth
I told you, you'd be sorry if I fucking left
I'd laugh while you wept
How's it feel now, yeah, funny ain't it,
you neglected me
Did me a favor though my spirit free you've set
But a special place for you in my heart I have kept
It's unfortunate but it's

Too late for the other side

Too late for the other side
Caught in a chase

I feel like when I bend over backwards for you,
all you do is laugh
Cause that ain't good enough,
you expect me to fold myself in half
Til' I snap, don't think I'm loyal?, all I do is rap
How can I moonlight on the side
I have no life outside of that
Don't I give you enough of my time
You don't think so do you?
Jealous when I spend time with the girls
Why I'm married to you still man I don't know
But tonight I'm serving you with papers,
I'm divoricing you
Go marry someone else and make 'em famous
And take away their freedom like you did to me
Treat 'em like you don't need them,
and they ain't worthy of you
Feed 'em the same shit you made me eat
I'm moving on forget you oh, now I'm special?
I ain't felt special when I was with you
All I ever felt was this helplessness
Imprisoned by a selfish bitch
Chew me up and spit me out
I fell for this so many times, it's ridiculous
And still I stick with this
I'm sick of this,
but in my my sickness and addiction
You're addictive as they get
Evil as they come, vindictive as they make 'em
My friends keep asking
why I can't just walk away from
I'm addicted, to the pain, the stress, the drama
I'm torn in,
so I guess imma mess, cursed and blessed
But this time I ain't changing my mind
I'm climbing out this abyss
You screaming as I walk out that I'll be missed
But when you spoke of people
who meant the most to you
You left me off your list, fuck you hip-hop
I'm leaving you,
my life sentence is served bitch And it's just

You never wanted someone so bad ya
Sweating, but If I'm what you wanted
Why'd you panic when I grabbed ya

I was bound to work a number on your back and
Throw your spine out of alignement

So stop with the stall, pick your pint up

There is too much to lose
Wake up behind these trenches
You run around defenseless
There is too much to lose
You cannot fill these shoes
I just wanna be famous, but
Be careful what you wish for
I stuck my dick in this game like a rapist
They call me Slim Roethlisberger
I go berserker than a fed-up post office worker
I murk her with a Mossberg
I'm pissed off, get murdered
Like someone took a ketchup squirter
Squirted a frankfurter
For a gangster, you sure did shit your pants
When you saw the chainsaw get to waving
Like a terrible towel
How thangs turn around when his fangs come out
Get your brains blown out
That's what I call blowin' your mind
When I come back, like nut on your spine
I'm a thumb tack that you slept on, son
Now here I come, screaming ""Attack! ""
Like I just stepped on one
Low on the totem 'til he showed 'em defiance
Giant scrotum
He don't owe them bitches shit
His britches, he outgrowed 'em
He's so out cold
He's knocked out at the South Pole
And nobody fucks with him
Rigor mortis and post mortem
He's dyin' of boredom
Take your best rhymes, record 'em
Then try to thwart him
He'll just take your punch lines and snort 'em
Shit-stained drawers, you gon' fuck with a guy
Who licks the blades of his chainsaws
While he dips 'em in P. F. Chang's sauce?
Game's up, homie
Hang it up like some crank calls
You think I'm backin' down?
You must be out of your dang skulls
I'm almost famous
You dream of trading places
I have been changing faces
You cannot fill these shoes
There is too much to lose
Wake up behind these trenches
You run around defenseless
There is too much to lose
You cannot fill these shoes
I just wanna be famous, but
Be careful what you wish for
I'm back for revenge
I lost a battle, that ain't happenin' again
I'm at your throat like strep
I step, strapped with a pen
Metaphors wrote on my hand
Some are just stored in my memory
Some I wrote on a napkin
I do what I have to to win
Pullin' out all stops
Any who touch a mic prior's
Not even Austin Powers
How the fuck are they Mike Myers?
And tell that psycho to pass the torch to the wacko
'Fore I take a shit in his Jack-O-Lantern
And smash it on his porch
Now get off my dick!
'Dick''s too short of a word for my dick
Get off my antidisestablishmentarianism, you prick!
Don't call me the Champ
Call me the Space Shuttle Destroyer
I just blew up the Challenger
Matter fact, I need a lawyer
I just laced my gloves with
Enough plaster to make a cast
Beat his ass naked
And peed in his corner like Verne Troyer
Y'all are Eminem backwards: you're Mini Mes
See, he's in a whole nother weight class
He's slugs, you're BBs: you're bean-bag bullets
You're full of it
You were dissin' his CD's, laughed at Infinite
Now he's back like someone pissed in his wheaties
No peace treaties, he's turned into a beast
His new Slim Shady EP's
Got the attention of the mighty D. R. E
He's almost famous
You dream of trading places
I have been changing faces
You cannot fill these shoes
There is too much to lose
Wake up behind these trenches
You run around defenseless
There is too much to lose
You cannot fill these shoes
I just wanna be famous, but
Be careful what you wish for
Now there he goes in Dre's studio
Cuppin' his balls
Screamin' the wood off the panelin'
Cussin' the paint off the walls
Spewin' his hate to these haters
Showin' no love for these broads
He ain't givin' them shit
He says he'll pinch a penny so hard
He'll leave a bruise on the bronze so dark
You can see the mark
With the scars, 'til Abraham Lincoln is screamin' out, ""Ahh! ""
These metaphors and similes ain't similar to them
Not at all
If they don't like it, they can all get fucked
Instead of suckin' him off
They can go get a belt or a neck tie to hang themselves by
Like David Carradine
They can go fuck themselves and just die
And eat shit while they at it, he's fuckin' had it
He's mad at the whole world
So go to hell and build a snowman, girl
The bullies become bullied
And pussies get pushed
Then they better pull me
Take me back to 9th grade to school me
'Cause I ain't lookin' back, only forward
This whole spot blowin'
Who coulda known he'd grow to be a poet and not know it?
And while I'm bein' poetic
Let me get it stoic and raise the bar
Higher than my opinion
Of these women's been lowered
So bear witness to some biblical shit
There's a cold wind blowin'
This world ain't gonna know what hit it
He did it, he made it, he's finally famous"
Love The Way You Lie ,Recovery,2010,"(Rihanna)
Just gonna stand there and watch me burn
That's alright because I like the way it hurts
Just gonna stand there and hear me cry
That's alright because I love the way you lie
I love the way you lie
(Eminem)
I can't tell you what it really is
I can only tell you what it feels like
And right now it's a steel knife in my windpipe
I can't breathe but I still fight while I can fight
As long as the wrong feels right it's like I'm in
flight
I offer love drunk from my hate
It's like I'm huffing paint and I love it the more I
suffer
I suffocate
And right before I'm about to drown she
resuscitates me
She fucking hates me and I love it
Wait
Where you going
I'm leaving you
No you ain't
Come back
We're running right back
Here we go again it's so insane
Cause when it's going good it's going great
I'm Superman with the wind in his back
She's Lois Lane
But when it's bad it's awful
I feel so ashamed
I snap
Who's that dude?
I don't even know his name
I laid hands on him
I'll never stoop so low again
I guess I don't know my own strength
(Rihanna)
Just gonna stand there and watch me burn
That's alright because I like the way it hurts
Just gonna stand there and hear me cry
that's alright because I love the way you lie
I love the way you lie
I love the way you lie
(Eminem)
You ever love somebody so much
You can barely breathe
When you're with them
You meet
And neither one of you
Even know what hit them
Got that warm fuzzy feeling
Yeah them chills
Used to get them
Now you're getting fucking sick
Of looking at them
You swore you've never hit them
Never do nothing to hurt them
Now you're in each other's face
Spewing venom
And these words
When you spit them
You push
Pull each other's hair
Scratch, claw, pit them
Throw them down
Pin them
So lost in the moments
When you're in them
It's the craze that the corporate
Controls you both
So they say it's best
To go your separate ways
Guess that they don't know you
Cause today
That was yesterday
Yesterday is over
It's a different day
Sound like broken records
Playing over
But you promised her
Next time you'll show restraint
You don't get another chance
Life is no Nintendo game
But you lied again
Now you get to watch her leave
Out the window
Guess that's why they call it windowpane
(Rihanna)
Just gonna stand there and watch me burn
That's alright because I like the way it hurts
Just gonna stand there and hear me cry
that's alright because I love the way you lie
I love the way you lie
I love the way you lie
(Eminem)
Now I know we said things
Did things
That we didn't mean
And we fall back
Into the same patterns
Same routine
But your temper's just as bad
As mine is
You're the same as me
But when it comes to love
You're just as blinded
Baby please come back
It wasn't you
Baby it was me
Maybe our relationship
Isn't as crazy as it seems
Maybe that's what happens
When a tornado meets a volcano
All I know is
I love you too much
To walk away now
Come inside
Pick up your bags off the sidewalk
Don't you hear sincerity
In my voice when I talk
Told you this is my fault
Look me in the eyeball
Next time I'm pissed
I'll aim my fist
At the dry wall
Next time
There will be no next time
I apologize
Even though I know it's lies
I'm tired of the games
I just want her back
I know I'm a liar
If she ever tries to fucking leave again
I'mma tie her to the bed
And set this house on fire
Just gonna
(Rihanna)
Just gonna stand there and watch me burn
That's alright because I like the way it hurts
Just gonna stand there and hear me cry
that's alright because I love the way you lie
I love the way you lie
I love the way you lie"
You're Never Over,Recovery,2010,"(Hook)
The days are cold, livin' without you
The nights are long, I'm growing older
I miss the days of old, thinkin' about you
You may be gone, but you're never over
(Verse 1)
If Proof could see me now, I know he'd be proud
Somewhere in me deep down
there's something in me he found
That made him believe in me, now no one can beat me now
You try, it'll be them doors
Andre's Phantom, believe me clowns
That means suicide homie, you'll never throw me
Off of this course, blow me
Bitch I do this all for the sport only
But I want it all, I'm not just talking awards homie
And the balls in my court, and it's lonely
On top of the world when you're the only
One with the balls in your shorts
To leave them jaws on the floor with no remorse
Remember that when they get to doggin' you boy homie
So y'all can just get to bloggin' about bologna
I'm not gonna stop the saga
Continue, no stoppin' the force Obi
I'm moppin the floors with them, I keep try'na pass it
But they keep on droppin' the torch
And it won't be, long til this sport is O-V-E-R
Just Blaze and me, we are knockin' them doors and
No we ain't pumpkins on Halloween
but we'll show up on your porch, so be
Careful what you say
there ain't no punks over here so follow me
Through the fog like I'm S-N-double-O-P
Let me guide you through the smoke G
If only I wasn't travellin' down this road by my lonely
No one who knew me like you will ever know me
I don't think you understand how much you meant to me
(Hook)
The days are cold, livin' without you
The nights are long, I'm growing older
I miss the days of old, thinkin' about you
You may be gone, but you're never over
And it don't stop (oh)
And it don't quit (oh)
And it don't stop (oh)
And it don't quit (oh)
And I miss you (oh)
I just miss you (oh)
I just miss you (oh)
Homie, I'll never forget you (no)
(Verse 2)
For you, I wanna write the sickest rhyme of my life
So sick it'll blow up the mic, It'll put the dyna in mite
Yeah, it'll make the dopest MC
wanna jump off a bridge and shit himself
Tap dancin' all over the beat
it'll jump off the page and spit itself
Yeah it's the best thing I could do
right now for you Doodi is to rap
So I'mma fuck til' I die, yeah I'mma do it to death
And instead of mourning your death
I'd rather celebrate your life
Elevate to new height, step on the gas and accelerate
I'mma need two mics
'Cause the way that I'm feelin' tonight
everything I can just do right
There's nothing that I can do wrong
I'm too strong and I'm just too hyped
Just finished the rhyme and bust it
and excuse the corny metaphor
They'll never 'ketchup' to all this energy that I've 'mustard'
So God just help me out
while I fight through this grieivin' process
Try'na process this loss is makin' me nauseous
But this depression ain't takin me hostage
I've been patiently watchin' this game
pacin' these hallways
You had faith in me always
Proof you knew I'd come out of this slump
rise from these ashes
Come right back on they asses
and go Mike Tyson on these bastards
And Imma show 'em, blow 'em out the water
slaughter 'em homes
I'll own so many belts
the only place they can hit me is below 'em
Homie I know I'm, never gonna be the same without you
I woulda never came in this game
I'm going insane without you
Matter of fact it was just the other night
had another dream about you
You told me to get up
I got up and spread my wings and I flew
You gave me a reason to fight
I was on my way to see you
You told me nah Dudey
you're not layin' on that table I knew
I was gonna make it
soon as you said think of Hailie, I knew
There wasn't no way that I was gonna ever leave them babies
And proof Not many are lucky enough
to have a guardian angel like you
Lord I'm so thankful
please don't think I don't feel grateful, I do
Just grant me the strength that I need
for one more day to get through
So homie this is your song, I dedicate this to you
I love you Dudey
(Hook)
The days are cold, livin' without you
The nights are long, I'm growing older
I miss the days of old, thinkin' about you
You may be gone, but you're never over

And it don't stop (oh)

Untitled,Recovery,2010,"Girl I think
You just might'a tried to pull a
muh'fucking fast one, I'm mad
You just hurt my goddamn feeling
and that was the last one I had
Does this look like an arcade?
Tryna play games? See this saw blade?
See the silhouette of a stalker in your walk-way?
Better co-operate
Or get saute'd and rotisseried while you're hog-tied
Mc's get so quiet you can hear a
muh'fuckin dog whistle while I walk by
'Colt Seavers' on a mule
stuntin on that ass like the fucking Fall Guy
I don't gas my Mercedes afther midnight
man I treat it like a Mogwai
Cuz it will turn into a Gremlin and
run over kids, women and men
Vrinn-vrinn! Motor's so big you can
fit a midget in his engine
Bitch, give me them digits while you're cringin'
Not by the hair on my chinny chin chin
While I spin spin even ten cents
on you, since when
Do you think it's gonna cost me a pretty penny?
Shiit, if I think a penny's pretty
just imagine how beautiful a quarter is to me
Eenie meenie miney mo
Catch an eskimo by his toe
While he's trying to roll a snowball but
Don't make him lose his cool
If he hollers better let him go y'all
Now here we go, go go!
Get up! Baby get a move on, like a U-Haul
You can rack your brain like pool balls
You will never think of this shit
Yeah, honey you called?
Well here I come, Havoc on the beat, I reek it
Evil I see, hear and speak it
Lady put your money on Shady
Fuck that other weak shit
Put your eggs in the same basket
You can count every muh'fucking
chicken fore' it hatches
Cuz, you can bet your ass
that we gone get it crackin'
Like a Kraken an Titans when they're clashin'
Get your brains bashed in so bad
You gone have Kurt Kobain askin
To autograph a bloodstained napkin
I'm fashionable and 'bout as rational
as a rash on a fag's asshole
Now let's take that line, run it
up the flag pole with Elton
See if he's cool with it
Don't stand there and look stupid at me bitch
I ain't in the mood for this shit
Get my dick, Google it til it pops up
Y'all are so motherfucking full of shit that you stopped up
Me I'm always shitting diarrhea of the mouth
Till your speakers crap out [fart] ""Ohp, what? ""
Girl you got a hot butt
like a lit cigarette ""Chik-Chigarrete""
But you won't get a hot fudge Sundae from me
So do not strut my way, slut! Because
Now here we go, go, go
And now that I got your panties in a bunch
and your bowels in an uproar

Stop asking me what the fuck for

Cuz I'm a fucking [problem] , Run boy!
Every flow got it mastered
So every last word that you fucking fags heard
comes straight from the fishes ass, Yeah
In other words I'm a bass (turd) !
Looking at me like I killed Kenny
Gassing the tank near steal plenty
No morals are instilled in me
So remorse I really don't feel any
Eat your heart out, Hannibal
Understandable why you're jealous, fucking animal
I got cannibal magnetism
can't resist him now, can ya hoe?
""Shady, I don't understand your flow""
Understand my flow?
Bitch I flow like Troy Polamalu's hair, boy
Don't you dare try to
follow or compare, boy
I'm raw, you ain't even medium rare
stay the fuck outta my hair, boy!
You can look, you can stare and point
But you can't touch
I'm too clairvoyant
I don't get it man, is there a void
All this weak shit, what am I steroids?
Well bitch I'm back with some shit for that ass

And remember boys
Now here we go, go, go!
Thank you for coming out!
Hope you enjoyed the show!
Til next time... haha
Peace!"
Ridaz,Recovery,2010,"Aw man, yea
You ever be in the club man, you get in a fight
And people that you don't even know jump in?
You feel like you wanna hit something, your fist clenches, your pissed
You just wanna get someone with shit, jump on this You're bout to get the shit pushed in, I'm just inches away
I'm splitting your shit wide open, no stitches could save
So die with your eyes open, you hope this isn't the way
You end up going out, but I guess it just is I'm afraid
Razors, scissors and blades make Jason say isn't this great
On-lookers participate in this ass-kicking debate
They're starting to take place in the middle of the street
Little did you know there'd be an all-out brawl soon as you heard this beat
Emergency personnel rush to the murder scene, but it is too late
It's absolute pandemonium, you whisked away
In a ambulance is your fate, nothing nobody told you when you left your house today coulda made you anticipate
Such an ass whooping, okay, til the anger dissipates
You get punched in the face, reciprocate
So what the deal, ridaz?
Would you excuse me while I feel my nuts?
My balls are feeling a-mighty big now
I might just have to dig down and pull em through my britches
I said...
So what the deal, ridaz?
Would you excuse me while I feel my nuts?
My balls are feeling a-mighty big now
I might just have to dig down and pull em through my britches
You step in the place with enough misplaced anger to catch a case
Anxious to get in some shit, got your gangstas all with your ladies
You better go get your mace cuz shady said so
You may wanna pick up the radio and bang it against your face
That's how fucking rowdy you feel, now do you still wanna grill?
If you don't wanna get the shit beat outta you, chill
Cuz if you doubt me you will, yea got me a pill, found me a thrill
I got a couple of drinks here and I'm bound to refill
Girl howdy, how do you feel ma?
This cocksucker did not spill my drink, Oh HELL no
He must be tryna kill my buzz, I will not budge
And what the deal ridaz?
Now here they all come and they got your back in like 2 seconds flat
That's probably a record yea, you wasn't expecting that
Cuz they want in on the act, there's a cognac-
Bottle, we snuck it in cuz the beer that they were serving here was only tap
I'm biting, I fight dirty, you might get kicked in the nuts
You're frightened like this guy might hurt me
You're quite certain he's nuts, I've hit myself in the face harder
Play smarter, you may start a rope but you need a chainsaw to
Dig your way out of, go powder your nose-
Pussy the louder you yell, the harder I slap the shit out of you hoes
You set it off faggot, so now how do you spose-
We settle it, hit me in the nose, we'll see how it goes
So what the deal, ridaz?
Would you excuse me while I feel my nuts?
My balls are feeling a-mighty big now
I might just have to dig down and pull em through my
britches
I said...
So what the deal, ridaz?
Would you excuse me while I feel my nuts?
My balls are feeling a-mighty big now
I might just have to dig down and pull em through my britches
It's shear hustle, I bob, weave, deflate your beer muscles
We're tussling, the crowd's starting to cheer us
And adrenaline's rushing through us just like a geyser gushing
Too much Budweiser in my blood, I'm strangling your windpipe
And nothing my signatures, ligature marks
Look at you all big with your remarks, and I swing an icepick at your heart
At least that's what it feels like when I pick you apart
And dig at you and break you down like the bitch that you are
The predicament starts when I throw a brick at your car
The pain inflicted upon you, it's so sick, it's bizarre
Shit, this is almost ridiculous, addictive as far
As having me wanna rip out your frickin ligaments ARGH!
You hit like a bitch, you scratch me with your nails, for that-
You catch an open-hand slap, break off your nail like BAP!
In fact, I'll have the crowd smacking you themselves
Where's D12, I don't feel like doing this by myself
So what the deal, ridaz?
Would you excuse me while I feel my nuts?
My balls are feeling a-mighty big now
I might just have to dig down and pull em through my
britches
I said...
So what the deal, ridaz?
Would you excuse me while I feel my nuts?
My balls are feeling a-mighty big now
I might just have to dig down and pull em through my britches"
Session One ,Recovery,2010,"[Intro]
Ladies and gentlemen
Make some noise
Aw shit
Yeah
Y'all ready to get this shit started or what
Alright
Well I brought some friends with me too
[Verse 1 - Eminem]
Now I ain't back just for the sake of just saying I'm back
I could relax but I'd rather stack ammo on tracks
Couple Xanax light a couple wax candles then black out
And relapse till I yack Jack Daniels and yap
Burp bubbles, attitudes Immaturing
Double shot of bacardi, party
Vision is blurring, woh ho
I can't see shit
My words get to slurring uh oh
You can call me R Kelly now or you're in trouble
What's incurring before after enduring the show
Has no baring on the bad news I'm baring whoa
what is it word play?
No I'm pushing you out the dumps
So suck my dick on the couch if you wanna cushion the blow
Now stomp your fucking feet till you get to squishing a hoe
It's pandemo-nium standin' oh when you see him oh
Damn baby you look good you're giving me wood
You should pull over like a sweat shirt with a hood
Snap work a napoleon you and me both
Break bread while I'm coppin' over this game now pinch a loaf
Now homie who's your favorite pain in the ass
Who claims to be spitting the same flames as me
I'm Kanye when he crashed
In other words I got the hood on smash
Like I stepped on the gas destroyed the front end
Deployed the damn airbags from the dash
Went through 'em and laughed
Came back an hour after the accident
And bit a goddamn jaw-breaker in half
So stop taping the funk and start shaking ya ass
Slaughterhouse in the house with the caucasian the rap
Just Blaze on the track
What the f-ck is more amazing than that slut
Answer me that, Royce where you at?
[Verse 2 - Royce D' 5'9""]
I'm right here Fire Marshall, verbal pair of pliers
Are prying you apart tune-up on your head designed by a bar-stool
Designed by a cartoon, before I need to be hired
Jimmy 'Io fire Marshall
The 9 tucked against the lining
I pull it out and flip your partner upside-down
Like ya'll are a couple 69ing
It's like Rick James is shooting up your house n-gga
F-ck your couch n-gga
You screaming f-ck the world with your middle finger up
While I'm over here shoving my dick in a hole in the mud
My b-tch, know I'm perfectly fit for murder
Because I murdered her, so you can call me Nickel the Oj the Glove
I got a Posse of Insane Clowns
Blow your brains on your opposite ear
Then ask you how your brain sounds
Bad, evil, weirdo, Alfred Ego, mad cerebral, you on your last burrito
(What that mean Nickel?)
It's a rap if you eating, get a beat then terrorize that b-tch like I'm Middle Eastern
Slaughterhouse on fire, nobody touchin' that
Good day and good night, Ortiz where the fuck you at?
[Verse 3 - Joel Ortiz]
I'm right here my Nike Airs buzz light-years ahead of my mic peers
Quite scary to look at, a nightmare, where my book at I'll write fear
In the heart of you tight squares, I harbor the art of you night square
It's tight ware 'cause that made me hotter than my dear
Uncle Al's breath after polishing off his 9th beer
Homie chill listen, I swear, I'm God, I give tracks a holy feel
And they bite ears
I'm right here, why wouldn't I be, just waiting to be hooked to Ivs
Monroe's brown when you look at my pee
And this joint, no exception, so just point a direction, and record the pig's oink
When I rip his intestines
This isn't just an infection
This won't go away with penicillin injections
Millions of questions arouse after they did an inspection
What I exhibit, seems to be non-contagious yet anybody can get it
Aw shit I did it again, when I lit with this pen, I admitted this phlegm
This time along side Em and the Em
So tell a friend to tell a friend, write a disgusting hook
Jump in shark water and swim, yo where the f-ck is Crook?
[Verse 4 - Crooked I]
I'm right here letting the shotty pop
Quick as a karate chop, get your body shot, get your top chopped like a lollipop
Come with Maserati drop in the body shot
Get your mommy knocked, and your Uncle Tommy molli-wopped
I take your life to the 9th inning
A knife in a gunfight I love it me and my knife winnin'
I laugh when you fall the shit will be funny
I buy my bitch a new a-s and watch her sit on my money
Man all the bitches holla, they wanna drop my bridges than jaw my dick and swallow
Leave drawers in this Impala, I ball like Iguidala,
I bear more arms than 6 koalas
As soon as a I draw get sent to Alaba
I kill with the tongue, I'm Atilla the Hun, I'm Genghis Khan, I'm a genius spawn
I pillage your village for fun, And genius gun, a syllable gun
Real as they come, Long Beach Sadan
Slaughterhouse equals swine flu
As I fly we do what you try to do without trying
'Cause to us it's so easy, where, jump-off Joe Beezy"

And I ain't even planning to call
I want this shit forever man, ever man, ever man

Last name ever
First name greatest
Like a sprained ankle boy
Ain't nothing to play with

And your city faded off to brown, Nino
She insists she got more class, we know!
Swimming in the money come and find me, nemo
If I was at the club
You know I ball, Kimo
Drop the mixtape that shit sounded like an album
Who'd have thought a country wide tour would be
the outcome
Labels want my name
But sign X like Malcom
Everybody got a deal, I did it without one
Yeah nigga I'm about my business
Killing all these rappers
You would swear I had a hit list
Everybody who guided me is asking for forgiveness
If you ain't been a part of it at least you got to
witness, bitches

Big fame, big chains
I stuck my dick inside this life until that bitch came
I went hard all fall like the balls teams
Just so I can make it rain all spring
Y'all seen my story my glory
I had raped the game young
You can call it statutory
When a nigga blow up
They can build statures of me
Old money Benjamin Button, whaat, nuttin
Now superbad chicks giving me macLovin
You would think I ran the world
Like Michelle's husband
You would think these niggas would know me
When they really doesn't
Like they was down with the old me
No you fucking wasn't
You're such a fucking loser
He didn't even go to class bueller
Trade the Grammy plaques just to have
My granny back
Remember she had that bad hip
Like a fanny pack
Chasing that stardom would turn you into a maniac
All the way in Hollywood and I can't even act
They pull their cameras out
And God damn they snap
I used to want this thing forever
Y'all can have it back
(Drake)
It may not mean nothing to y'all
But understand nothing was done for me
So I don't plan on stopping at all
I want this shit forever man
Ever man, ever man
I'm shutting shit down at the mall
And telling every girl she the one for me
And I ain't even planning to call
I want this shit forever man ever man, ever man
(Lil Wayne)
Ok, hello is the martian
Space Jam Jordams
I want this shit forever wake up
And smell the Garden
Fresh then the hardest
Step up to the target
If I had one guess than I guess I'm just New Orleans
And I will never stop like I'm running from the cops
Hop up in my car and told my chauffeur to the top
Life is such a fucking roller coaster then it drops
But what should I scream for this is my theme park
My minds shine even
When my thoughts seem dark
Pistol on my side you don't wanna hear that thing talk
Let the king talk check the price and pay attention
Little Wayne that's what they got to say or mention
I'm like Nevada in the middle of the summer
I'm resting in the lead I need
A pillow and a cover
Schhhhhhh, my foot is sleeping on the gas
No brake pads no such thing as last
(Drake)
It may not mean nothing to y'all
But understand nothing was done for me
So I don't plan on stopping at all
I want this shit forever man
Ever man, ever man
I'm shutting shit down at the mall
And telling every girl she the one for me
And I ain't even planning to call
I want this shit forever man, ever man, ever man
(Eminem)
There they go, back in stadiums
As Shady spits his flow
Nuts they go, can't contain me
And they go so balistic whoa
He can make them look like bozos
He's wonderin if he should spit this slow
Fuck no, go for broke, his cup
Just runneth over oh no
He aint had a buzz like this
Since the last time he overdosed
They have been waiting patiently
For pinnochio to poke his nose
Back into the game and they know
Rap will never be the same as before
Bashin' into the brains of these hoes
And Establishin' a name as he goes
The passion and the flame is ignited
You can't put it out once we light it
This shit is exactly what the fuck
That I'm talking bout when we riot
You dealin' with a few true villians whose staying
inside of the booth truth spillin'
And spit true feelings until our tooth fillings
Come flying up out of our mouths now rewind it
Payback muthafucka for the way that you got at me
How's it taste? When I slap the taste
Out of your mouth with the bass so loud
That it shakes the place
I'm hannibal lecter so just in case
You was thinkin of savin face
You aint gonna have no face to save by the time
I'm through with this place so drake
(Drake)
It may not mean nothing to y'all
But understand nothing was done for me
So I don't plan on stopping at all
I want this shit forever man
Ever man, ever man
I'm shutting shit down at the mall
And telling every girl she the one for me
And I ain't even planning to call
I want this shit forever man, ever man, ever man"
Hell Breaks Loose ,Relapse: Refill,2009,"[Eminem]
I want you to understand something
That when I come up in this b-tch I want the fans
jumping,
I want the fist pumping in the air,
I don?t look like a millionnaire,
But I feel like a million bucks,
Ladies won't ya fill your cups,
Shady?s come to fill ya up,
If your a D or a C cup
You can even be a B
It's just me and Dre
You?ll be in the Er we?ll be strapped with so much
Tnt,
We may blow no not even Cpr from the Emt
Could help you to resuscitate
You busters must be flustered wait
You can't cut the mustard, what's your problem Can?t you bust a grape,
What's my name, shady came and just crushed the game,
It's really not even fair to them,
Cos they pale in comparisons
So much they might as well wear a skin,
Don't you just wish you could share his pen
Cos this sh-ts getting embarrassing,
The fog is stinking the air is thin,
Cos he won't even let them try to breathe,
Da da di di da di dee, he makes it look so easy,
Girl you just hit the lottery,
[Chorus]
Now this should be the part of the song that they drop the needle on,
And hell breaks loose,
Try to restrain us you can't contain us,
We still gonna make a statement no matter what we do,
Everywhere we go it seems we're looking for any excuse to just cut loose,
So this should be the part of the song that they drop the needle on
And hell breaks loose,
[Dr Dre]
This is when sh-ts hits the fan,
Like it just splattered on stan
This is the only moment that matters,
Ya homie rolled in with Mathers,
Like chaos erupts Em?s in back Dre?s in the front
So do what we say at once this songs like a Seance, it haunts,
[Eminem]
It makes em stay in a trance
No choice they have to dance,
[Dr Dre]
It's like the play-off just making sure that we stay in the hunt
Take a day off of what man you better lay off the
blunts
You must be smoking something
You think I ain't smoking nothing stay off my nuts,
Now hit the floor baby time to wipe away all the
rust,
Shake all them cobwebs loose,
Loosen up with a little bit of Grey Goose,
Yeah girl shake that caboose
I don?t wanna see you try to make no excuse,
Dre is on the loose,
A Mongoose when it's comes to the chronic use,
You know I can?t stand to lose,
Me and my goons are like animals,
We come through like a pack of wolves,
So we came here to retract the roof,
Yeah man ain't that the truth,
Girl your man?s like in the booth
Definitely back up in this b-tch,
This is when all hell breaks loose,
[Chorus]
[Eminem]
Now I know you're feeling discouraged but homie just mark my words,
A murderer in the flow, liquid courage I'm finna blow
As soon as we hit the door power surges head to toe
I?m sure to push it as far as words are meant to go,
We?re in the indigo Winnebago with tinted windows,
Ferocious as we proceed to beat up the block widcha hoe,
With speakers knocking it's 3 o'clock
Me and Doc then proceed to drop E
And hop out the vehicle and knock on your door,
[Dr Dre]
Yeah so let us in ?fore we huff and puff and we blow,
We ain't bluffin for nothing
We?ll knock the stuffing out ya
Revenge is so sweet, move til ya injure ya feet
Yeah move or lose it three,
Move to the beat, lose yourself indubitably,
Pass some of that (?) lil right there,
That would be pretty stupid to me,
Born and raised in the Cpt,
Yeah Los Angeles who?s in the streets,
Them haters hating on me,
But I refuse to lose any sleep,
Keep that deuce deuce in the seat,
Dre fall off that's news to me,

Buffalo Bill,Relapse: Refill,2009,"[Eminem - verse 1]
Better watch out sucker now I got ya where I want ya,
Onslaught, coming and I?m packing in my lunch up,
Bunch a missile launcher and a bunch a contra-ban,
Van full of ganja, now come on jump,
Man stop marchin marshall on my gotcha,
Doin? the cha cha and the kucharcha with a
Quadri-plegic,
Boogieing down to Frank Sinatra,
Lyndsay to the Lohan naked while you let me watch ya,
Who da knew the buddah do to me what?s it?s done,
Such cynicism when this isn?t in my system,
Blunt hypnotism, lift the spliff up to my lip son,
So much on my hands, I got to give my kids a fist
Pump,
Chris-to-pher reeves swimming in my swim trunks,
Mister, ?help me? what?s he said to me and then sunk,
Women skinning them and cutting them up in chunks,
In comes the woman with cocoa butter skin ones,
[chorus]
Once again they call me buffalo bill,
Buffalo bill, buffa-buffalo bill,
Skin em up, hym em,
Sew em up in those kilts, up in those kilts,
Upa upa up in those kilts,
Man you don?t want to go up in those hills,
Up in those hills, uppa up in those hills
You better beware, stay clear of buffalo bill, buffalo bill,
Buffa-buffalo bill,
[verse 2]
Always, you can see em lurking in the hallways,
Carcasses of caucasian females in his crawl space,
How the hell did he fit em all in such a small space,
Hide em in the wall but how long will the dry wall
Take,
Well f-ck it then, I got nothing but time, I?ll wait,
Until its dries for the moment I guess your all safe,
After I sand it and buff it I guess that I?ll paint,
My chainsaw?s outta gas my regular saw aint,
Now here I come again, damn stomach rumbling,
You can even hear the evil spirits coming from
Within,
Someones in, the back of my damn house rummaging,
It?s a girl, she looks pretty thin but I want to skin,
Been on the hunt again, when will it ever end,
Evelyn why you trying to fight you will never win,
Severing legs, arms, damn there goes another limb,
Pull the lever then trap door, death is evident
[chorus]
[verse 3]
Now what you know about buffalo bill,
Nothing so chill,
F-cking hoe, you better f-cking hold still,
Make sure none of that lotion in that bucket don?t
Spill,
Cut em gut em and just keep stuffing those girls,
Man I think she had enough of those pills,
Sedate her, then I wait her come back later just
To clutch on those steel blades
Braids, baby when I cut ya dont squeal
I hate the loud noises I f-cking told you,
I keep hearin voices like wouldntcha like to go and
Get your butcher knife
And push it right through her
While you put your shishkebab skewer into her,
Barbeque her, or would you do to her what you usually
Do to a girl who?s skins newer
[yoda]
In a world of sin doer this is turning into a torment
Tournament of sorts,
Christmas ornament you are,
[eminem continued]
I?ll be sure to gensu ya til there?s no more skin to ya,
Boo ya who ya think you f-cking with,
Duck because here he comes again,

Elevator,Relapse: Refill,2009,"Hook
There once was a saying that I used to say
Back in the day when I met Dre
I used to sit and goof on the phone with, my friend proof
That if I went gold, I'd go right through the roof
He said ""what If you went platinum"", I'd just laugh at him
That's not happening, that I can't fathom
Eighty something million like it's worldwide,
Later I'm living in a house with a fucking elevator
Verse 1
Haters getting mad, they done had enough of shady
You slay me, nothing you say matters enough that you shame me
Rappers try to play me, they use Hailie as a ukulele
Woopsa that a fucking daisy
That's an honour who even she knows dada's fucking crazy
Fucking animal, cookoo, bananas, fucking Av
Maybe it's because I never had a mother raise me
Fuck around and throw a baby at another baby
You may think it's cause of the way that I was brought up
But it's all caught up to me now, palm is in the waters
Every line I ever said has got me in a corner
You might think it doesn't creep upon ya, but it all does
You wouldn't listen man, I tried to warn ya when you started
Now your brains all horny cause of all the shit you thought of
Chainsaw slaughters turn your daughters into sawdust
I never thought it'd come to this, I outta just be honest but

Sorry Lance, Mr. Lambert and Aiken ain't gonna make it
They get so mad, when I call them both fake it's
All these fucking voices in my head I can't take it
Someone shut that fucking baby up, 'for I shake it
You're standing adjacent to Jason's last slut, they're facing
Together makes 'em, a fucking bad combination
I lashed at the doctor in my last operation
Shoved the weiner snitzel up his ass, hopped away some-
body please stop the patient, get the cops to mase him
Homie, I'm the shizer, pass doctor dre some
I can't leave the game, I just can't walk away son
No not-a now, not a chance, not today son
I can't believe I leave for one breif second
You pussy queef all over the rap game, naked
And use a leaf to wipe up the crap stains, feck it

Elevator in my house, I'll smell ya later
I blew the fuck up, a hamster in a microwave-I
Think about an escalator now, steps, I hate 'em
Told the neighbor step away, then I just pepper sprayed 'em
Yeah, for every time you ride down the street
Or hideout, drive by my house and beep
Like now motherfucker, try now to sleep
Lie down motherfucker, try countin' sheep
And you're tryna find out, why now there's beef?
Mase in your face bitch, cry now pussy
This is my house, all nine thousand feet
So you can suck my dick with Amy Winehouse's teeth
Then I shove 'em in the elevator, take 'em to the top
Stand above em,just to cut the fucking cable, let 'em drop
Walk an hour to the damn refrigerator, get a pop
While I let 'em fall all the way to the basement yelling stop!

blood curdling your gurgling on your blood,
what I do for my next trick,
Im feeling won-derful,
I think I might just do something a little less subtle,
shove a f-cking tonka truck up a little kids butthole,
feel the wrath of a psychopath slash ambassador of the valentines day massacre slash assassin
i slash her in the ass with a icicle
and leave her laying a blood bath
while I put a catheter in
and jump in the bath with her,
in my spiderman mask man
just imagine the fun I can have with a strap on,
stick it up Kim Kardashian’s ass and make the b-tch run a triathlon,

Music Box,Relapse: Refill,2009,"[Intro]
Yo, yeah girl,
Can you hear that? It's playing our song..
Are you sleepy? Take a nap..
You're not afraid of the dark? Are you.?
[Verse One]
You hear the beat as it makes ya not wanna go to
sleep
I knock on Dakota's door, its locked so I go to creep
round the back, with binoculars, not cause I wanna
peep
But because I'm hungry she smells like tacos
I wanna eat
Visions of hot chocolatey marshmallows
all so sweet
With sugar plums, oh look here comes Marshall he's on your street
He's placing hot smoldering charcoals
beneath your feet
Now walk on 'em, he's dancing with carcasses cheek to cheek
Like a Thanksgiving turkey, or holiday ham
Cinnamon sprinkled on toast, strawberry marmalade jam
Flavor my favorite graham crackers with John Bennet
Rams
I guess a modern day Jack the Ripper is all that I am
[Chorus]
(My music box)
Cos when the lights are off, I see the girls asleep
(My music box)
But I can hear you my love, you keep calling me (My
music box)
And when we're Worlds apart, you mean the World to me
(My music box)
If you call, I'll come, I will answer (My music box)
Cos when the lights are off, I see the girls asleep
(My music box)
I hear my music box, playing a song for me (My music
box)
So when she twirls around do a whirl for me (My music
box)
Won't you be my private little dancer (My music box)
[Verse Two]
I almost look comatose, who wants to be sober gross
I foam like a Doberman, mouth open I overdose
Put coke up my nostrils, in both my holes and I plug
my nose
My pupils quadruple in size, eyes are so bugged I
know
I put on my mother's make up, get naked and run
around
Wavin' the gun around, I think I'm down to a hundred
pounds
There's thunder, I wonder how come it rains but the
sun is out
The devils upset with his wife, they must be sluggin'
it out
I must be buggin' the fuck out, but what the fuck
about'
Voices are leading me up to the attic, I love my
house
They pull and they tug my blouse, the sound of a music
box
Comes from inside a toy chest, but what do I do, it's locked
I pick it and open it but it's stuffed full of human parts
I dig till I find it, I wind it up and the tune just starts
Its playing a song, so beautiful and the room is dark
The moon is full, I smell a funeral, guess
I'll loom in the park
[Chorus]
[Verse Three]
I'm fixated on asphyxiating and breakin? this little
chick's
Neck like a pixie stick
The sick Satan worshippin', bitches get
horse-whippins,
I'm in the back, through the back door, slip in
Through the crack leavin' the corpse drippin'
The mortician of love, sent from above,
forced and treat em all (?)
(?) stingy I've become
Been doin' this for more than a quarter century, I'm
just numb
Am I dreamin', is it real? Someone pinch me on the
buns
The time has come to tie her up, gotta roll me the
ladder
I'd had enough of the chatter, climb up to the window,
look at her
then climb in and slowly shatter her brain matter and
batter her
with the bat, a matter of fact that will splatter her
But before I do that, I'll have a chat to flatter her
Give her two compliments, back-to-back, like Tabatha
I'm your secret admirer, I'm back to ravish ya
So strong is your fight, but your no match for
Dracula
Prolonging her plight, as I go back to stabbin' her
Dismember her limbs, simple as that, cadaver her
Zoom in with the lens, then pan back, the camera
Stand back, cuz here comes your man Jack, so Pamela

Dr. West: There's alot of them aren't there?
Eminem: Well, 12 but-
Dr. West: Christ, I don't even know them all.
Eminem: Really...
Dr. West: Anything else?
Eminem: Um, well I mean the only other question I have
is, like what do I do if I find myself in the situation
where maybe somebody's drinking around me or something
like that, and I get tempted to-
Dr. West: Take a drink.
Eminem: What?
Dr. West: Take a drink! And you know, and... take the
edge off.
Eminem: Take the edge off? Man if I have a drink, I
already know what that's going to lead me to...
Dr. West: What, you mean these?
Eminem: Now what the fuck!?
Dr. West: MARSHALL, WHAT'S THE MATTER DARLING? HAVING

Your walkin down a horror corridor
It's almost 4 in the mornin'
And your in a
Nightmare
It's HORRIBLE
Right there's the corinor
Waitin for you
To turn the corner
So he can corner ya
Your a goner
He's ona ya
Out the corner of his cornea
He just saw you run
All you want is to rest
Cause you can't run anymore
Your done
All he wants is to kill you in front of an audience
While everybody
Is watchin in the party applauding it
Here I sit while I'm caught up in deep thought again
Contemplading my next plot again
Swallowin a colata pin
While I'm noddin
In and out on the autumn and
If the ramada inn
Holdin onto the pill bottle then
Stick my finger and swirl it round the bottom
And make sure I got all of it
Wake up naked at mcdonalds
With
Blood all over me
Dead bodies
Behind the counter
SHIT
Guess I must of just blacked out again
NOT AGAIN
(Chorus)
It's 3 a.m in the mornin
Put my key in the door
There's bodies layin all of the floor and
I don't remember how they got there but I guess I must
have killed em
Killed em
I said
It's 3 am in the mornin
Put my key in the door
There's bodies layin all of the floor and
I don't remember how they got there but I guess I must
of killed em
Killed em
(Verse 2)
Sitting nude in my living room
It's almost noon
I wonder what's on the tube
Maybe they'll show some boobs
Surfing every channel
Until I find hannah montana
Then I reach for the aloe and lanalin
Bust all over the wall panel and dismantlin
Every candle on top of the fire place
Mantalin
Grab my flannel and my bandana then
Kiss the naked manakin man again
You can see him standin in my
Front window
If you look in
I'm just a hooligan
Who's use to usin hallicinogens
Causin illusions again
Brain contusions again
Cutting and bruising the skin
Raise the scissors and pins
Jesus when does it end
Phases that I go through
Dazed and not so confused
Days that I don't know who
Gave these molecules too
Me
What am I gone do
Hey the prodical son
The diabolical one
Very mythogical
When I slaughtered them
(Chorus)
It's 3 a.m in the mornin
Put my key in the door
There's bodies layin all of the floor and
I don't remember how they got there but I guess I must
have killed em
Killed em
I said
It's 3 am in the mornin
Put my key in the door
There's bodies layin all of the floor and

She puts the lotion in the bucket
He puts the lotion on the skin
Or else it gets the hose again
She puts the lotion in the bucket
He puts the lotion on the skin
Or else it gets the hose again
I cut and I slash slice and gash
Last night was a blast
I can't quite remember when I
Had that much fun
Off a half pint fifth of jack
My last vic and a half
A flashlight
Up kim kardashians ass
I remember the first time
I dismembered a family member
December I think it was
I was having drinks with my cuz
And I wrapped him
In christmas lights
Pushed him into the stinkin tub
Cut him up into pieces
Then just when I went to drink his
Blood
I thought I outta drink this bath water
That outta be fun
That's when my days of serial murder man slaughter
begun
The sight of blood excites me
That might be an artery son
Your blood coverin screams
Just don't seem to bother me none
It's 3 am
And here I come
So you should probably run
A secret passage way around here
Man there's got to be one
Oh no there's probably none
He can scream all that he wants
Top of his lungs
It ain't no stoppin me from choppin him up(up)
(Chorus)
Cause it's 3 a.m in the mornin
Put my key in the door
There's bodies layin all of the floor and
I don't remember how they got there but I guess I must
have killed em
Killed em

My Mom,Relapse,2009,"Yo yo, alright, i'm gonna lay the chorus first
Here we go now.
My mom loved valium and lots of drugs
And that's why I am like I am cause I'm like her
Because my mom loved valium and lots of drugs
That's why I on what I on cause I'm my mom.
My mom my mom I know youre probably tired of hearing about my mom Oh ho! Whoa ho!
But this is just a story of when I was just a shorty and how I became hooked on va-al-ya-hum
Valium was in everything food that I ate,
The water that I drank fucking peas on my plate,
She sprinkled just enough of it to sea-son my steak,
So everyday I have at least three stomach aches,
Now tell me what kind of mother would want to see her
Son grow up to be an under a undera-fuckin-chiever,
My teacher didn’t think I was going be nothing either,
What the fuck you sticking gum up under the fucking seat for?
Mrs. Mathers your son has been huffing ether,
Either that or the mother fuckers been puffing reefer,
But all this huffing and puffing wasn’t what it was either,
It was neither I was buzzing but it wasn’t what she thought,
Pee in a tea cup? Bitch you aint my keeper, im sleeping,
What the fuck you keep on fucking with me for?
Slut you need to leave me the fuck alone I aint playing,
Go find you a white crayon and color a fucking zebra.
My mom love Valium and lots of drugs,
That why I am like I am cause I’m like her,
Because my mom love Valium and lots of drugs,
That why I’m on what I’m on cause I’m my mom.
Wait a minute this aint dinner this is paint thinner,
You ate it yesterday I aint hear no complaints did I?
Now here’s a plate full of pain killers now just wait till I crush the Valium and put it in your potatoes you little mother fucker ill make you sit there and make that retarded fucking face without even tasting it, you better lick the fucking plate you aint wasting it,
Put your face in it before I throw you in the basement again,
And I aint giving in, your gonna just sit there in one fucking place spinning again till next thanksgiving and if you still aint finished it I use the same shit again then when I make spinach dip it will be placed into shit, you little shit want to sit there and play innocent, A rack fell and hit me at k mart and they witnessed it, child support, your father he aint slipped us shit and so what if he did that aint none of your dang business kid.
My mom there's noone else quite like my mom
I know why should let bygones be bygones
But she's the reason why I am high but I'm high on cause.
My mom love Valium and lots of drugs,
That why I am like I am cause I’m like her,
Because my mom love Valium and lots of drugs,
That why I’m on what I’m on cause I’m my mom.
My mom loved valium now all I am
Is a party animal, I am what I am
But I'm strong to be finished wit' me val-ium spinach
But my bars only last about two minutes
But I don't wanna swallow it without you in it
I can't even write a rhyme without you in it
My valium, my vaaa-eh-elll-liummmmm maaaaaaannnnnnnnnnnnnn.
Man I never though that I could ever be
A drug addict nah, fuck that I can't have it happen to me
But that's actually what has ended up happenin, a tragedy
I'm fuckin passin it up catchin me
And it's probably where I got acquainted with the taste ain't it?
Pharmaceuticals of the bomb i'm beautiful
Secure the fuckin dog with the medicine she done fed it
Feed it a fuckin aspirin and say that it has a headache
Here want a snack, you hungry you fuckin rat
Look at that, it's a Zanex, take it and take a nap
Eat it, but I don't need it, well fuck it then brake it up
Take a little piece and beat it before you wake Nathan up
all right Ma you win, I don't feel like arguin
I'll do it, pop and gobble it and start wobblin
Stumble hobble tumble slip drip then I fall in bed
With a bottle of meds and a Heath Ledger bobblehead.
My mom love Valium and lots of drugs,
That why I am like I am cause I’m like her,
Because my mom love Valium and lots of drugs,
That why I’m on what I’m on cause I’m my mom.
My mom i'm just like her
My mom my mom my mom x2
My mom my mom my mom, my mom, my momma
Meh mommeh, eh likah momma.
Ha ha, sorry mom, still love you though
Dr. dre 2010, hey this shit is hella hard homie
Yo take us on outta here.

Insane,Relapse,2009,"[Verse 1]
I was born with a dick in my brain, yeah fucked in the head
My stepfather said that I sucked in the bed
'Til one night he snuck in and said
We're going out back, I want my dick sucked in the shed
Can't we just play with Teddy Ruxbin instead?
After I fuck you in the butt, get some head
Bust a nut, get some rest
The next day my mother said
""I don't know what the fuck's up with this kid!""
The bastard won't even eat nothing he's fed
He just hung himself in the bedroom he's dead
Debbie, don't let that fucker get you upset
Go in there, stick a fuckin' cigarette to his neck
I bet you he's fakin' it, I bet you
I bet he probably just want's to see how upset you would get
I'll go handle this of course, unless you object
Ahh go fuck his brains out, if any's left in his head
[Chorus]
If you could count the skeletons in my closet
Under my bed and up under my faucet
Then you would know I've completely lost it
Is he nuts? No! He's insane!
If you could count the skeletons in my closet
Under my bed and up under my faucet
Then you would know I've completely lost it
Is he nuts? No! He's insane!
[Verse 2]
Did you get him? Naaw, fucker tried to bite my face off
I just got fuckin' chased off with a chainsaw
Then he took the chainsaw, bit the fuckin' blades off
Ate the blades, stuck a baseball in a slingshot
Then he aimed at his own face, let the thing pop
Took his eye out, picked it up and played ping pong
Then he played ping pong with his own ding dong
That motherfucker's got nuts like King Kong
Then he set the lawn mower out on the dang lawn
And he laid all up underneath it with the thing on
Then he took his pants, he took every fuckin' thing off
everything, except his tank top and his training bra
Ain't he raw? Yeah maniac, that's Shady dog
Man that motherfucker's gangsta, ain't he dog
Shady dog, what be going through that fuckin' brain of yours
Say no more, what the fuck you waitin' for, sing along
[Chorus]
If you could count the skeletons in my closet
Under my bed and up under my faucet
Then you would know I've completely lost it
Is he nuts? No! He's insane!
If you could count the skeletons in my closet
Under my bed and up under my faucet
Then you would know I've completely lost it
Is he nuts? No! He's insane!
[Verse 3]
Don't you know what Felch means? (Yeah), well then tell me
Would you rather get felched or do the felching
Fuck him in the ass, suck the cum out while you're belching
Burp, Belch, then go back for a second helping
Can you dig what I'm sayin' man, can you smell me?
I want you to feel me like my step father felt me
Fuck a little puppy, kick the puppy while he's yelping
Shady what the fuck you saying? I don't know help me!
What the fuck's happening, I think I'm fucking melting
Marshall I just love you boy, I care about your well being
No Dad, I said no, I don't need no help peeing
I'm a big boy, I can do it by myself see
I only get naked when the baby sitter tells me
She showed me a movie like ""Nightmare on Elm Street""
But it was X, and they called it ""Pubic Hair on Chelsea""
Well this is called ass rape,
And we're shooting the jail scene
[Chorus]
If you could count the skeletons in my closet
Under my bed and up under my faucet
Then you would know I've completely lost it
Is he nuts? No! He's insane!
If you could count the skeletons in my closet
Under my bed and up under my faucet
Then you would know I've completely lost it
Is he nuts? No! He's insane!"
Bagpipes From Baghdad,Relapse,2009,"INTRO:
Aahhhh
Oh, it's music to my ears, oh man
How can I describe the way I feel...fucking great man
Ok, let me see how can I begin
VERSE 1:
Locked in Mariah's wine celler all I had for lunch
Was bread wine, more bread wine and captain crunch
Red wine for breakfast and for brunch
And to soak it up an in-between snack crackers to munch
Mariah what ever happened to us
Why did we have to break up
All I asked for was a glass of punch
You see I never really asked for much I can't imagine what's
Goin through your mind after such
A nasty break-up with that Latin hunk
Louis Miguel, Nick Cannon better back the fuck up
I'm not playin I want to back you punk
This is Hello Kitty bedspread satin funk
Mixed with Egyptian with the little rappin punk
Zappin Eric Clapton (shap brings apercrunk-and yea-baby)?
I want another crack at ya
You can beat me with any spatula that you want
I mean I really want ya bad ya cunt
Nick you had your fun
I've come to get ya when your sack got jumped
Man I can use a fresh batch of blood
So prepare your vernacular for Dracular acupuncture
CHORUS:
Bagpipes from baghdad
When will it ever cease
For Pete's sakes he's crazy to say the least
Bagpipes from baghdad
What's goin through my mind
Half the time when I rhyme we're blowin up like
Bagpipes from baghdad
Someone turn the vacancy sign on
Cause i'm gone, blowing up like
Bagpipes from baghdad
I run the streets and mack
Like a madman holdin a glack
VERSE 2:
You can be a permanent fixture in my lyrical mixture
I'm the miracle whip, a trickster
My (sicknitch)? a sound when a tube of lipstick's around
I'm bound to put it on in an instant wow man
What an ensemble, what an assortment of armour
(suticals)? just beautiful build us to my (palm-a)?
Cuticles get residue cause i'm touchin the bottle
Never knew I could remind me so much of my momma
I'll cut ya like Dahmer, pull the butcher kife on ya
The size of a sword boy i'm like the fuckin ruts on ya
Get it stuck in your cornea, nice knowin ya Norman
Your so fuckin annoyin, drop the shovel boy
You don't know what the fuck your doin
I ain't playin no fuckin more
Eminem Bagpipes From Baghdad lyrics found on
Nick Cannon you prick I wish you luck with the fuckin war
Every minute there's a sucker born, snuck up on
Maliki made the motherfucker suck on a struck of corn
Shucker, shuck a corn, shuck a corn
Hit Jason in the face with a hockey puck and tell em it's fuckin on
Man what the fuck are ya doin
You're runnin over the snowblower with the lawnmower
Blowin your bagpipes from baghdad

VERSE 3:
In the bed with two braindead lesbian vegetables
I bet you they become heterosexual
Nothing will stop me from molestin you
Titty-fuckin you til your breast nipple flesh tickles my testicles
Is what they said to the two conjoined twins
How's it going girlfriends, you need a boyfriend
You need some ointment, just set up an appointment
Who's gonna see the doctor first, we'll do a coin flip
I just got my one-year sorbiety coin chip
When the bad get goin, how bad does the going get
Baby you shouldn't have any trouble rubbin groins wit
Each other especially when you're joined at the hip
I'm going to get the needle and thread from the sewing kit
An attempt to separate 'em and stitch 'em back at the loin shit
Lure the little boy with the chocolate chips ahoy! chip

Hello,Relapse,2009,"[Intro:]
Hello... Allow me to introduce myself... My name is, Shady.
It's so nice to meet you...It's been a long time...
Sorry I've been away so long...
My name is, Shady... I never meant to leave you
[Verse 1:]
You see that chick in the gym, checkin' me out
Any second I'm 'bout to stick her neck in my mouth
I lose a pill, and I'm wrecklessly wreckin' the house
That was supposed to be breakfast, where the heck is it now?
There's the neckless I lost right next to Stephanie's blouse
Man I should check to see if my mom left any out
Nope, guess I'll re-route
Maybe somewhere in the depths of the couch
Opp, jackpot, yeah, open sesame mouth
Down the hatchet, and the feelin' you can't match it
I rat-tat-tap on your door with the damn ratchet
Ata-tac-tacking' a whore with the damn hatchet
A knapsack pack with like 40some Xanax's
Shorty come back, I'm tryn' score me some lap dances
I'm bout to relapse, so baby pour me some Jack Daniels
Forumla 44D and 40's with mad capsules
The bad apple spoils the bunch, I'm back at ya
[Chorus:]
Girl I don't mean any harm all I wanted to do is just say Hello
And are you menstruating baby, my lil' friends waitin' to say Hello
The way your titties are wiggling and your booties shakin' like jello
Girl I don't mean any harm all I wanted to do is just say Hello
[Verse 2:]
Yeah
My equilibrium's off, must be the lithium
I don't need to buy any drugs, man people give me 'em
It just becomes everyday, extra curriculum
No reason inparticular, it was strictly fun
a 5th of rum and 2 bottles of 151
51 people asleep in my damn living room
Excuse me hun, but what is your name, Vivienne?
I woke up next to ya naked and err, did we um
Of course we did, but didn't I strap a jimmy hun?
I'm looking for the torn rapper but there don't seem to be one
No offense baby girl, I don't mean any harm
[ Eminem Lyrics are found on www.songlyrics.com ]
But disease is something I'm tryna keep my penis free from
I find the package and I'm cool, I immediately run
Like Speedy Gonzales, see if I see anyone
Who might have a couple of 3's I'm fiendin' for some
My head is pounding to the beat of the drum
[Chorus:]
Girl I don't mean any harm all I wanted to do is just say Hello
And do ya happen to have anything on ya to make my mood mellow?
Some are oval and some are pink,
some are blue and some are just yellow
Girl I don't mean any harm all I wanted to do is just say Hello
[Verse 3:]
Oh, those were the days, they certainly were
It's hurtin' me to know that I'll be closin' that curtain for good
Word, word, word, word, word, word, word
I second that and a third, rushed to emergency surgery
To try to flush me because of the drugs that he purchased
He's no longer getting them free, 100 bucks for these Percodans
Plus it's getting to be where he lustfully searched the den
Pain is hitting his knee and his muscles be hurting him
Tirelessly on the phone trying to russle up, muscle relaxants
For his back, and a couple of Pax's, now he's doubling backwards
And he's stumbling back, slipped and fell, hit his back bone
Heard something go crack, Now he's up in the bathroom
Like he's busting a nap, almost ended it that soon
Because of the fact, I'm just busting my own chops
While I'm busting a rap, resuscitated and rejuved, so fuck it I'm back
[Chorus:]
Girl I don't mean any harm all I wanted to do is just say Hello
And do ya happen to have anything on ya to make my mood mellow?
Some are oval and some are pink,
some are blue and some are just yellow
Girl I don't mean any harm all I wanted to do is just say Hello
[Outro:]
And so I'm sayin' Hello... Allow me to introduce myself...
My name is, Shady.
It's so nice to meet you...It's been a long time...
Sorry I've been away so long...
My name is, Shady... I never meant to leave you

Same song and dance.
(VERSE TWO)
The first victim i had, she was a big one
big movie star, party girl, big fun
she was the girl the media always picked on
in and out of rehab every 4-6 months
she was always known for little pranks and slick stunts
on nickelodeon flashed to little kids once
what an event it was, i was sitting in front
i was hooked in at the first glimpse of them buns
seen her backstage, now here's where i come in son
look her she comes i'd better put out the big guns
""hello lindsay you're looking a little thin, hun'
how about a ride to rehab? get in cunt!
starting off on the wrong foot is what i didn't want
girl im just kidding let me start over again, hun
see what i meant was we should have a little intervention
come with me to brighton, let me relieve your tension
you little wencher, murder wasn't my intention
if i wanted to kill you it would have already been done
slowly she gets in and i begin to lynch her with 66 inches of extension chord
(HOOK)
Yeah baby do that dance
It's the last dance you'll ever get the chance to do
Girl shake that ass
You ain't ever gonna break that glass, the windshield's too strong for you

You sexy little thing
Show me what you got, give it your all, look at you ball, why you crying to me?
Same song and dance.
(VERSE THREE)
My second victim was even bigger than the first
pop star, icon, the whole works
she played a little schoolgirl when she first
burst upon the scene and seen the world was hers
she twirls and turns and flirts and skirts so bad it hurts
it irked me and made me mad at first
i lashed out in my songs
but what was really going on was that i had developed a crush, i just didn't know how to tell it to her
should i cut off one of my ears and mail it to her?
send her pictures of my collections of skeletons or
footage of me impaling myself on an elephant's tusk?
we'll settle this once and for all, ima tell her at dusk
tonight, tonight its the night, and tell her i must
creep upto her mansion in stilhettos and just
climb the gate and ring the bell, like ""hello my love""
i just picked your prescription for ceriquill up
now would you like to share a pill or two with me?
i'll share my valium with you cos im feeling you britney
i'll trade you a blue one for a pink one ever since at schoolgirl juvenile delinquent
i've been feeling you ooh ooh girl you sexy little girl
you hold that pill any longer it'll get sentimental value
come on toots give me the valium, i'll slamdunk it in your mouth till you puke
and just as soon as you pass out in your alphabet soup

Player… Who can really blame you (who can really blame you)
We're the ones who (chicka) made you *cough, cough*
(VERSE ONE)
Back by popular demand
Now pop a little Zantac or ant'-acid if you can
You're ready to tackle any task that is at hand
How does it feel, is it fantastic, is it grand?
Well look at all the massive masses in the stands
Shady man… no don’t massacre the fans
Damn, I think Kim Kardashians a man
She stomped him just cause he asked to put his hands
On her massive Gluteus maximus again
Squeeze it, then Squish it, then pass it to her friend
Can he come back as nasty as he can
Yes he can, can, don’t ask me this again
He does not mean to lesbian offend
But Lindsay please come back to seeing men
Samantha’s a 2, You’re practically a 10
I know you want me girl,
In fact I see your grin
(Now come in girl)
(CHORUS)
When you walked through the door
It was clear to me (clear to me)
You’re the one they adore, who they came to see (who they came to see)
You’re a … rock star (baby)
Everybody wants you (everybody wants you)
Player… Who can really blame you (who can really blame you)
We're the ones who made you
(VERSE TWO)
The enforcer, looking for more women to torture
Walk up to the cutest girl and Charlie Horse her
Sorry Portia, but what’s Ellen DeGeneres
Have that I don't, are you telling me tenderness?
Well I can be as gentle and as smooth as a gentleman
Give me my ventolin inhaler and 2 Xenadrine
And I'll invite Sarah Palin out to dinner then
Nail her, 'Baby say hello to my little friend'
Brit f’rget K-Fed let’s cut off the middle man
Forget him or your gonna end up in the hospital again
And this time it won’t be for the Ritalin binge
Forget them other men, girl pay them little atten-tion
A little did I mention, that Jennifer's in-
Love with me John Mayer so sit on the bench
Man I swear them other guys you give ‘em an inch
They take a mile, they got style, but it isn't Slim
(CHORUS)
When you walked through the door
It was clear to me (clear to me)
You’re the one they adore, who they came to see (who they came to see)
You’re a … rock star (baby)
Everybody wants you (everybody wants you)
Player… Who can really blame you (who can really blame you)
We're the ones who made you
(VERSE THREE)
And that’s why… my love
You'll never live without,
I know you want me girl cause I can see you checking me out
And baby, you know, you know you want me too
Don’t try to deny it baby, I’m the only one for you
(Fart)
Damn girl I’m beginning to sprout an Alfalfa
Why should I wash my filthy mouth out
You think that’s bad you should hear the rest of my album
Never has there been such finesse and nostalgia
Man Cash, I don’t mean to mess up your gal but
Jessica Alba put a breast in my mouth (brrp)
Wowzers, I just made a mess of my trousers
And they wonder why I keep dressing like Elvis
Lord help us he's back in his pink Alf shirt
Looking like someone shrinked his outfit
I think he’s about to flip
Jessica rest assure, Superman’s here to rescue ya
Can you blame me?
You’re my Amy, I’m your Blake
Matter fact make me a birthday cake
With a saw blade in it to make my jail break
Baby, I think you just met your soul mate
(Now break it down girl)
(CHORUS)
When you walked through the door
It was clear to me (clear to me)
You’re the one they adore, who they came to see (who they came to see)
You’re a … rock star (baby)
Everybody wants you (everybody wants you)
Player… Who can really blame you (who can really blame you)
We're the ones who made you
So baby, baby
Get down, down, down
Baby, get down, down down
Baby, get down, down down
Baby, get down, get down
Baby, get down, down down
Baby, get down, down down
Baby, get down, down down
Baby, get down, get down
Oh Amy, Rehab never looked so good,
I can't wait, I’m going back!! HAHA Whooo!
DR DRE, 2020, Yeah"
Medicine Ball,Relapse,2009,"Oh my goodness, what have I done?
Oh no, I can't believe it
It's like I've got the whole world in my palm
And I'm ready to drop bombs
Welcome to the Slim Shady Mecca, Rebecca
It's the village in New York, right next to the
TriBeCa
That's my sector, homosexual dissector
Come again, rewind selector
I said nice rectum, I had a vasectomy, Hector
So you can't get pregnant if I buy sex and erect ya'
Hannibal Lecter into guy sex and I bet ya'
I tantalize ya' and in less then 5 seconds I get ya'
They say once bitten and twice shy
Well, I'm next to the guy with 9 ecstasy pills and 5 extra
Boxes of ripped condoms and quantities
Why? Yes sir, I took the rest of the Lunesta pills
from my dresser
That's my kind of vibe, what else should I try,
Lester?
Drop kicked the bitch before her second trimester
Performed a home abortion with Dexter
Then I guess, I'll dig a fetus out with a wire hanger then digest her
I guess it's time for you to hate me again
Let's begin, now hand me the pin
How should I begin it and where does it all end?
The world is just my medicine ball, you're all in
I said, I guess it's time for you to hate me again
Let's begin, now hand me the pin
How should I begin it and where does it all end?
My medicine ball, you're in my medicine ball, friends
All my West Side bitches throw it up
Put a balloon inside your pussy, quief and blow it up
Man, I think that Eggers fell off the tip, didn't show enough
So you better change the station to keep from throwing up
Man, you've seen it all before, you're all too
familiar with it
There's a penis on the floor and two balls so you know who did it
You know you with it girl, don't front, oh no, you
didn't
I won't rape all the Pussycat Dolls, Nicole, you
kiddin'?
I'll pee on Rihanna, see man, I'll do what I wanna
Spray perfume in a sauna room, crazy gluing Madonna
To the La-Z-Boy sofa, fold her in two then sit on her
Imagine the visual for that man who would've thought I
Could ever be such a relentless prick unleashing his vengeance
But the chick's so old, she looks like she outlived her life sentence
I never meant this rhyme to be so offensive
If you weren't so defensive, it wouldn't be, you're so sensitive
I guess it's time for you to hate me again
Let's begin, now hand me the pin
How should I begin it and where does it all end?
The world is just my medicine ball, you're all in
I said, I guess it's time for you to hate me again
Let's begin, now hand me the pin
How should I begin it and where does it all end?
My medicine ball, you're in my medicine ball, friends
Put Christopher Reeves on a unicycle with a kickstand
Kick it up and push him and lead him right into
quicksand
Here, you need a hand, big man?
Grab a hold of this branch with both hands
Man, they don't understand I'm just a sick man
Now everybody's pissed at me like it's my fault
This name rhymes with so many different words, geez
So one last time, Mr. Christopher Reeves
Won't you break it down for me and just spit the
verse, please
Eminem, I'm coming to kill you
Always hated you and I still do
You'll never fill my shoes, my Superman costume
Doesn't even fit you, they don't feel you
You're taking this shit too far
Who do you think you are? Hang my suit up in the
armoire
Everyday I hate you more and more
Throw down the cardboard
Let's break dance if you think you're hardcore
I guess it's time for you to hate me again
Let's begin, now hand me the pin
How should I begin it and where does it all end?
The world is just my medicine ball, you're all in
I said, I guess it's time for you to hate me again
Let's begin, now hand me the pin
How should I begin it and where does it all end?
My medicine ball, you're in my medicine ball, friends
The world is mine"

Old Time's Sake ,Relapse,2009,"[Eminem]
Good evening... This is your fucking captain speaking
We will soon be reaching an altitude of 4 million and a half feet
That's 8 million miles in the sky
Please undo your seatbelt for takeoff
You are now free to smoke up out the cabinet
.
[Dr. Dre]
I'm Dre from back in the day from
Nwa from black and the grey from
Chokin' a bitch to smackin' her face from
Stackin' up bodies to rackin' the K's up?
From rackin' up hits to stackin' the crates up
I'm still hungry and I'm back with a tapeworm
And what was happenin' in rap entertainment
Me and Shady, far as competition faggot there ain't none
.
[Eminem]
Speak of the devil, it's attack of the Rainman
Chainsaw in hand, blood stain on my apron
Soon as the blade spun, vrum they run away from
Who wanna play dungeon, no one is safe from
In search of a brain surgeon, a great one
Wait it ain't funny man, it's urgent I need one
Two boxes of detergent and a paint gun
And an emergency squirt gun to spray-a one
.
[Chorus]
So one more time for old time's sake
Dre drop that beat and scratch that break
And just blow a little bit of that smoke my way
And let's go (You're now smokin' with the best, best)
.
So one more time for old time's sake
Dre drop that beat and scratch that break
And just send a little bit of that smoke my way
And let's go (You're now smokin' with the best, best)
[Eminem]
.
Smoke signal in the sky like verizon wireless
A nice environment, suprise entirely
hypnotized by the sound I surround the hydrant
Takin' lives of firemen, say goodbye here I am again
Naked wives and vicodin
Before I begin to get to so high pussyboy I could spin
Vin vin Fuck the handle, I fly off the hinge
Let the boy off the bench coach, and throw it to him
There he goes in his trenchcoat, no clothes again
Baby make us some french toast and show us some skin
I show you every inch grows in my foreskin
Show me nipple, I pinch both and throw up a ten
Now you know it's a sin to tease, blow us again
The sorceror of intercourse, if it's forced it's him
Don't fight the feelin' if you're feeling the force within
When you wake up in the mornin' next to the porcelain
.
[Chorus]
.
[Dr. Dre]
Now when there's smoke there's fire
When there's fire there's flames
When there's flames there's Chronic
Either you high or you ain't
I got no time for no games
.
[Eminem]
Naah uh he ain't playin'
He's gon' get the Ak and aim it right at your bra-ain
I'm slightly insa-ane, back on Creatine
Hypnotic and red bull, it's an incredible energy drink
And It's givin' me wings, I believe I can fly
While I pee on a girl, you won't catch me Csi
It's as easy as pie, and as simple as cake
Dre get on the mic and make 'em tremble and shake
.
[Dr. Dre]
.
Now put your smoke up in the air, raise your Henny and Coke
And if you really wanna get fucked up, just let me know
We can smoke 'til there's no more lighter fluid to do it
Let's get in to it, your smokin' with the triedest and truest
I got the midas touch, when it comes to rollin' shit up
You mother fuckers ain't smokin' you just holdin' shit up
Now here we go let's get up, get down, hold up a blunt
I smoke the kind of stuff that makes the records go number one
Cause if at first you don't succeed, won't hurt to smoke some weed
Now them words are just a little more personal for me
Seein' as how, I blew up off from puffin' them trees
.
[Eminem]
We're smokin' up for me, fuck yeah light it up cheech
Cmon smoke me out cuz, gimme contact buzz
Get me on track, they love me when I'm on that stuff
But this is earth callin', Shady man cmon back What
Man we're losin' him, he won't even respond back, Fuck
Now look at all the pretty women in here (Damn bitches)
Dre it's hot, I think he better go check on their temperatures
I'll get the thermometer, you get the bandages
Now baby just bend over, just more of the damn bitches
.
[Chorus]"
Must Be The Ganja,Relapse,2009,"[Intro]
Yeah... Oh, oh! Yeah Yeah...Oh.. I feel like dancing, I feel like dancing
I smell something in the air that's making me HIGH!
I smell something in the air that's making me HIGH!
[Verse 1]
Ok here we go, Do-re-mi-fa-so-fa-so-la-ti so
Lyrical rascal, kick back the tobasco
You motherfucker's must just not know the tic-tac-so
Time to show you the most kickass flow in the cosmos
Picasso with a pickaxe, a sick asshole
tic-tac-toe comes with sixpack, with exact doe
Knives, strangling wives with dick-lasso
3 bags of the grass, Zig Zags, I'm with the Doc so
You know how that go, skull and the crossbones
This is poison to poison girls who do not know
You do not wanna try this at home my lovato
This is neither the time nor the place to get macho
So crack a six pack, sit back with some nachos
Maybe some popcorn, watch the show and just rock slow
It's not what you expected, not what you thought so
Bout time you wake the fuck up, smell the pot smoke
[Chorus]
It must be the Ganja, it's the marijuana
That's creepin' upon me, why I'm so high
Maybe it's the henny, that has gotten in me
Whatever's got into me I don't mind
I said it's the Ganja, it's the marijuana
That's creepin' upon me, why I'm so high
Maybe it's the henny, that has gotten in me
Whatever's got into me I don't mind
[Verse 2]
Your dreams are getting fulfilled, Ooh I'm literally getting a chill
Spitting at will, me and Dre have just finished splitting a pill
You're submitting to skill, sitting still
I'm admitting I'm beginning to feel like I don't think anyone's real
Faced with a dilemma, I can be Dalai Lama
And be calmer, ?? a step beyong a Jeffrey Dahma
Please don't upset me mama, you're looking sexy mama
Don't know if it's the lala, or the rum and pepsi mama
Don't wanna end up inside my refrigerator freezer
Be used as extra topping, then next time I make a pizza
How many people you know that can name every serial killer
Who ever existed in a row, put them in chronological order
Beginning with Jack the Ripper
Name the time and place from the body, the bag, the zipper
Location of the woods where the body was dragged and then dumped
The trunk that they was stuffed in, the model, the make, the plate
And which model, which state they found her and how they attacked the victim
Say what murder weapon was used to do what on which one
Which knife and which gun, what kid, what wife and which nun
Don't stop, I like this it's fun, the fuckin' night's just begun
[Chorus]
It must be the Ganja, it's the marijuana
That's creepin' upon me, why I'm so high
Maybe it's the henny, that has gotten in me
Whatever's got into me I don't mind
I said it's the Ganja, it's the marijuana
That's creepin' upon me, why I'm so high
Maybe it's the henny, that has gotten in me
Whatever's got into me I don't mind
[Verse 3]
When I'm behind the mic, dynamite's what it's kinda like
You're stuck with the same stick that you're tryna light
Behind the boards, it's Dre, legends are made this way
Isn't it safe to say, this is the way it should be?
Maybe you need some lyric syrup serum for your symptoms
Here's a dosage of the antidote, now you give him some
He can give her some, she can give them some
Get behind a lint drum, make up a beat and kill the sucker syndrome
The spinning drum when it comes to lyrics and pennin' some
Starting from scratch and then ending up at the ending of
Capable of winning her, Bullets are, so unbelievable its a
Titanium cranium that's full of suprises
When the smoke rises, right before your very own eyes
You stare into your stereos (hi)
Good evening, this isn't even a weed thing
I ain't even smoke anything, I ain't even drinking
[Chorus]
It must be the Ganja, it's the marijuana
That's creepin' upon me, why I'm so high
Maybe it's the henny, that has gotten in me
Whatever's got into me I don't mind
I said it's the Ganja, it's the marijuana
That's creepin' upon me, why I'm so high
Maybe it's the henny, that has gotten in me
Whatever's got into me I don't mind"

He's cold, spike him back and grab the back board
[Male Medic]
OK, got it, on 3... 1, 2, 3
Huh-let's move..."
Deja Vu,Relapse,2009,"[Intro]
Dmc, we have a mid-thirties male found down, unresponsive
Possible overdose, substance unknown,
Pulse is sixty and thready
Respiration's eight, he's intubated and we're baggin' him now
Bp, ninety over palp,
Patient is cool, pale and diaphoretic
Has aspirated, Gsc is three,
We'll update en route, Eta, ten minutes
[Verse 1]
As I fall deeper into a manic state
I'm a prime candidate for the gene to receive the drug outta trate
The blood pressure climbs to a dramatic rate
I seem to gravitate to the bottle of Nyquil than I salivate
Start off with the Nyquil with like I think I will just have a taste
Couple of sips of that than I gradually graduate
To a harder prescription drug called valium like yah thats great
I go to just take one than I end up like having eight
Now I need something in my stomach because I haven't ate
Maybe ill grab a plate of nachos and ill have a steak
And you'd think with all I have at stake
Look at my daughters face
Mommy something is wrong with dad I thank
Hes acting weird again
He''s really beginnings to scare me
Won't shave his beard again
And he pretends that he doesn''t hear me
And all he does eat dorritos and cheetos and he just
Fell asleep in his car eating three muskateers in the rear seat
[Chorus]
Sometimes I feel so alone, I just don't know
It feels like ive been down this road before
So lonely and cold it's like something takes over me
As soon as I go home and close the door
God feels like déjà vu I wanna get away from this place I do
But I cant and I won't say I try but I know it's a lie
cause I don't and why I just don't know
[Verse 2]
""Maybe just a nice cold brew, what's a beer?""
That's the devil in my ear
I been sober a fuckin' year
And that fucker still talks to me
He's all I can fuckin' hear
""Marshall, come on we'll watch the game,
It's the Cowboys and Buccaneers""
And maybe if I just drink half I'll be half buzzed
For half of the time, who's the mastermind behind that little line
With that kind of rationale man I got
half a mind
To have another half of glass of wine, sound asinine
Yeah I know, but I never had no problem with alcohol
Ouch, look out for the wall, aim for the couch - I'm 'bout to fall
I missed the couch and down I go lookin' like a bouncy ball
Shit musta knocked me out cause I ain't feel the ground at all
Wow, what the fuck happened last night, where am I
Man, fuck am I hungover and goddamn I
Got a headache, shit half a Vicodin, why can't I
All systems ready for take off, please stand by
[Chorus]
Sometimes I feel so alone, I just don't know
It feels like ive been down this road before
So lonely and cold it's like something takes over me
As soon as I go home and close the door
God feels like deja vu I wanna get away from this place I do
But I cant and I won't say I try but I know it's a lie
Cause I don't and why I just don't know
[Verse 3]
So I take a Vicodin, splash it hits my stomach then, ahhhh
Couple of weeks go by it ain't even like I'm
Gettin' high
Now I need it just not to feel sick,
Yeah I'm gettin' by
Wouldn't even be taking this shit if Deshaun
didn't die
Oh yeah, there's an excuse, you lose Proof so you use
There's new rules, it's cool if it's helpin' you to get through
It's twelve noon, ain't no harm in self inducin' a snooze
What else is new, fuck it what would Elvis do in your shoes
Now here I am three months later, full-blown relapse
Just get high until the kids get home from school, holmes, relax
And since I'm convinced that I'm an insomniac
I need these pills to be able to sleep so I take three naps
Just to be able to function throughout the day, let's see
That's an Ambien each nap, how many Valium, three
And that will average out to about one good hour's sleep
Ok so now ya, see, the reason how come, he
Has taken four years to just put out an album, B
See me and you we almost had the same outcome, Heath
Cause that Christmas you know the whole pneumonia thing?
It was bologna, was it the methadone ya think?
Or the hydrocodone you hide inside your pornos
Your Vcr tape cases, with your Ambien Cr
Great places to hide 'em, ain't it?
So you can lie to Hailie
I'm goin' beddy bye Whitney baby, good night Alaina
Go in the room and shut the bedroom door and wake up in
an ambulance
They said they found me on the bathroom floor, damn...
[Chorus]
Sometimes I feel so alone, I just don't know
It feels like ive been down this road before
So lonely and cold it's like something takes over me
As soon as I go home and close the door
God feels like deja vu I wanna get away from this place I do
But I cant and I won't say I try but I know it's a lie
Cause I don't and why I just don't know"
Beautiful,Relapse,2009,"Lately I've been hard to reach
I've been too long on my own
Everybody has a private world
Where they can be alone
Are you calling me?
Are you trying to get through?
Are you reaching out for me?
I'm reaching out for you....
I'm just so fuckin depressed
I just can't seem to get out this slump
If I could just get over this hump,
But I need something to pull me out this dump
I took my bruises, took my lumps,
Fell down and I got right back up
But I need that spark
To get psyched back up
In order for me to pick the mic back up
I don't know how or why or when
I ended up being in this position I'm in
I'm startin to feel distant again,
So I decided just to pick this pen
Up and try to make an attempt to vent
But I just can't admit or come to grips
With the fact that I may be done with rap,
I need a new outlet
And I know some shit so hard to swallow,
But I just can't sit back and wallow
In my own sorrow,
But I know one fact, I'll be one tough act to follow
One tough act to follow
I'll be one tough act to follow
Here today, gone tomorrow,
But you'd have to walk a thousand miles...
Chorus
In my shoes
Just to see
What it's like to be me
I'll be you
Let's trade shoes
Just to see what it'd be like to feel your pain
You feel mine, go inside each others minds
Just to see what we'd find
Look at shit through each others eyes
Don't let them say you ain't beautiful
They can all get fucked
Just stay true to you
Don't let them say you ain't beautiful
They can all get fucked
Just stay true to you
Verse 2
I think I'm startin
To lose my sense of humor
everythings so tense and gloom
I almost feel like I got to check the temperture
Of the room just as soon as
I walk in, it's like all eyes on me
So I try to avoid any eye contact
Cause if I do that, then it opens the door for conversation
Like I want that
I'm not looking for extra attention
I just want to be just like you
Blend in with the rest of the room
Maybe just point me to the closest restroom
I don't need no fuckin man servant
Tryna follow me around
And wipe my ass
And laugh at every single joke
I crack and half of them aint even funny like
""ahh, marshall you're so funny man
]you should be a comedian, god damn""
Unfortunately I am,
I just hide behind the tears of a clown
So why don't you all sit down
Listen to the tale I'm about to tell
Hell, we don't get to gotta trade our shoes
And you aint gotta walk no thousand miles
Chorus
In my shoes
Just to see
What it's like to be me
I'll be you
Let's trade shoes
Just to see what it'd be like to feel your pain
You feel mine, go inside each others minds
Just to see what we'd find
Look at shit through each others eyes
But don't let them say you ain't beautiful
They can all get fucked
Just stay true to you
Don't let them say you ain't beautiful
They can all get fucked
Just stay true to you
So...
Verse 3
Nobody asked for life to deal us what these
Bullshit hands were dealt
We gotta take these cards ourselves,
And flip them, don't expect no help
Now I could of either just sat on my ass
And pissed and moaned
Or take this situation in which I'm placed
And get up and get my own
I was never the type of kid to wait by the door
And pack his bags
Or sat on the porch and hoped and pray for a dad
To show up who never did
I just wanted to fit in, in every single place
Every school I went
I dreamed of being that cool kid
Even if it meant actin stupid
And aunt edna was told me
Keep makin that face it'll get stuck like that
Meanwhile I'm just standin there holdin my tongue
Tryna talk like ""thissss""
Till I stuck my tongue on that frozen stop sign
Pole at 8 years old
I learned my lesson then
Cause I wasn't tryin to impress my friends no more
But I already told you my whole life story
Not just based on my description
Cause where you see it
From where you're sittin
It's probably 110 percent different
I guess we would have to walk a mile
In each others shoes at least
What size you wear?
I wear 10's, let's see if you could fit your feet...
Chorus
In my shoes
Just to see
What it's like to be me
I'll be you
Let's trade shoes
Just to see what it'd be like to feel your pain
You feel mine, go inside each others minds
Just to see what we'd find
Look at shit through each others eyes
But don't let them say you ain't beautiful
They can all get fucked
Just stay true to you
Don't let them say you ain't beautiful
They can all get fucked
Just stay true to you
Lately I've been hard to reach
I've been too long on my own
Everybody have their private world
Where they can be alone
Are you calling me?
Are you trying to get through?
Are you reaching out for me?
I'm reaching out for you...
*talking*
Yeah, to my babies, stay strong
Dad will be home soon
And to the rest of the world
God gave you them shoes, to fit you
So put them on and wear em
Be yourself man
Be proud of who you are
Even if it sounds corny
Don't ever let anyone tell you
You aint beautiful"
Crack a Bottle ,Relapse,2009,"[Introduction - Eminem]
Ooooooh!!
Ladies and gentlemen!
The moment you've all been waiting for!
In this corner, weighing 175 pounds,
The record of 17 rapes,
400 assaults & 4 murders,
The undisputed, most diabolical villain in the world!
Slim Shady!
[Chorus - Eminem]
So crack a bottle, let your body waddle.
Don't act like a snobby model, you just hit the lotto.
Uh oh uh oh, bitches hopping in my Tahoe,
Got one riding shotgun and no not one of them got gloves,
Now where's the rubbers? Whose got the rubbers?
I noticed there's so many of them and there's really not that many of us,
Ladies love us and my boss's kicking up dust,
It's on till the break of dawn and we're starting this party from dusk,
[Verse 1 - Eminem]
Back with Andre The Giant, Mr. Elephant Tusk,
Picture us, you'll just be another one bit the dust,
Just one up my mother's son who got thrown under the bus,
Kiss my butt, lick my under cheese from under my nuts,
It disgusts me to see the game the way that it looks,
It's a must I redeem my name and haters get mushed,
Bitches lust, man they love me when I lay in the cut,
Missed the cut, the lady give a (?) some paper cut,
Now picture us, it's ridiculous you curse at the thought,
'Cause when I spit the verse the shit gets worse and worse cause your soft,
If I could fit the words as picture perfect, works every time,
Every verse, every line, as simple as nursery rhymes,
It's elementary. The elephants have entered the room,
I venture to say with the same repetition is true,
Not to mention back with a vengeance and hit the signal,
Of the bat symbol. The platinum dude is back on you hoes.
[Eminem]
Ladies and gentlemen...Dr. Dre!
[Verse 2 - Dr. Dre]
They see that low rider go by there, like Â""Oh my!Â""
You ain't got to tell me why you're sick cuz I know why,
I dip through in that six trey like sick Â'em Dre.
I'm an itch that they can't scratch, they're sick of me.
But hey, what else can I say? I love La,
Cuz over and above all, it's just another day,
And this one begins where the last one ends,
Pick up where we left off and get smashed again,
I'll be dammed, just fucked around and crashed my Benz,
Driving around with a smashed front end,
Let's cash that one in,
Grab another one from out the stable,
The Monte Carlo, El Camino or the El Derado,
The hell if I know, do I want leather seats or vinyl?
Decisions, decisions. Garage looks like precision collision,
Or Maico beats quake like Waco,
Just keep the bass low speakers away from your face though.
[Chorus - Eminem]
So crack a bottle, let your body waddle.
Don't act like a snobby model, you just hit the lotto.
Uh oh uh oh, bitches hopping in my Tahoe,
Got one riding shotgun and no not one of them got gloves,

[Verse 3 - 50cent]
It's sorta like pourin' Draino down a live volcano,
You never know what'll happen next, it may blow,
Same thing happens to the beats when Dre blows,
I talk shit, but my dick's long as my payroll,
I get ass like a ball player, but I'm a boss player,
Pimping hoes from here to Australia,
Till I get heart failure,
Look at ya half of ya'll, all scared,
Other half, hands up in the air, like Â""Awww yeah.Â""
This is our year, this is what you call sheer-
talent, but I think at this point it's just obvious,
Fears, they say my music's good for all queers,
Cuz I make your ear ring bitch. Ears and all queers,
Call us the mafia, we got the fucking mob here,
Gimme the hate and I'll feed off of ya's all year,
Shit, I'm just doing my job here, you don't want problem, do ya?
Fuck it, I'll even crack a bottle for ya.

So crack a bottle, let your body waddle.

(A terrible mist- are you wearing a bulletproof vest?)
And then you go and you do what?

While the music industry melts the fuck down?
Do you know how many people lost their jobs
because of your fuckin vacation?
(Well that's actually why I'm here,
I was gonna, put out some new music
and I wanted to play it for you, and get your opinion)
Do I really need to hear it?
Let me guess, another album about poor me,
I'm so famous that it's ruined my rich little life,
And I'm such a tortured artist.
Let me make music about it and my tragic love life,
Am I on to something here?
(Come on man it's not like that yo-)
You know what? Just hand the fuckin thing over
I'm done talkin to you.
Think you can just come and go as you please.

Underground,Relapse,2009,"[Eminem - Intro]
A lot of people ask me
Where the fuck I’ve been at the last few years
Shit I don't know
But I do know, I'm back now
HAHA
[Chorus]
Here comes the rain and thunder now
Nowhere to run, to run to now
I’ve disappeared, don’t wonder how
Looking for me
I'm underground
Here comes the rain and thunder now
Nowhere to run, to run to now

[Eminem - Verse 1]
Dre I’m down here, under the ground dig me up
Broken tibias fibias, yeah fix me up
Sixty sluts all of ‘em dying from mass afixial
After they sip piss through a Christopher Reeves sippy cup
Dixy cups toxins boxes of oxy pads
Enough oxycotin to send a fucking ox to rehab
Wack job in the back with a black stocking cap
Jacking off to a hockey mask at a boxing match
[you can't say that] yes he can
I just did faggot now guess again
Better text message your next of kin
Tell him shits about to get extra messy especially when
I flex again and throw a fucking lesbian in wet cement
So faggoty faggoty faggoty raggedy Ann and Andy
No raggedy Andy and Andy no it can't be, it can't be
Yes it can be the fucking anti christ is back Danny
Its Satan in black satin panties
This is Amityville calamity got damnit insanity pills
Fanny pack filled with zanax
Through every nook and cranny
lookin for trannys milk and cookies spilt on my silk neglociet looky
Razor balades wit me to make you bleed
cases of maboline make up lay on the table of weed
slim shady shit sounds like a fable to me
Until he jumps out the fucking toilet when you're taking a pee
[Chorus]
Here comes the rain and thunder now
Nowhere to run, to run to now
I’ve disappeared, don’t wonder how
Looking for me
I'm underground
Here comes the rain and thunder now
Nowhere to run, to run to now
I’ve disappeared, don’t wonder how
Looking for me
I'm underground
[Eminem - Verse 2]
Six seaman samples Seventeen strands of hair
Found in the back of a van after the shoot at Vanity Fair
Hannah Montana prepare to elope with a can opener
And be cut open like cantaloupe with canopy beds
With glad bags, yeah glad to be back
'Cause last year was a tragedy that landed me smack dab in rehab
Fucking doctor I didn’t understand a damn what he said
I planned to relapse the second I walked out of that bitch
Two weeks in Brighton, I aint enlighten
Bitin’ into a fucking Vicodin like I ‘am viking
Oh, lightning strike it might be a fucking sign I need a psychic
Evaluation, fuck Jason it’s Friday the nineteenth
That means it’s just a regular day
And this is the kind of shit I think of regularly
Fucking Lesbians shouldn’t of had her legs in the way
Now she’s pregnant and gay
Missing both legs and begging to stay.
[Chorus]
Here comes the rain and thunder now
Nowhere to run, to run to now
I’ve disappeared, don’t wonder how
Looking for me
I'm underground
Here comes the rain and thunder now
Nowhere to run, to run to now
I’ve disappeared, don’t wonder how
Looking for me

[Eminem – Verse 3]
Tell the critics I’m back and I’m coming
To spit back an abundance
Hit a fag with onions
Then split a bag of Funions
Mad at me understandable
Cannibal shooting animal
Out of a cannon and have him catapult at an adult
Captain of a cult with an elite following
To turn Halloween back to a Trick of Treat holiday
Have Micheal Myers looking like a liar
Swipe his powers replace his knife with flowers and a stack of flyers
Hit Jason Vorheys with a forty
Stuck a repository up his ass
And made him tell me a story
Gave Hannibal Elector a fucking nectarine
And sat him in the fucking fruit and vegetable section and gave him a lecture
Walked up elm street with a fucking whiffle bat drew
Fought Freddy Krougar and Edward Scissor hands too
And came out with a little scratch oww
Lookin like a got in a fuckin pillow fight with a triple fat goose
Insanity can It be vanity, wheres the humanity
In havin a twist of fantasy with a arm an leg amputee
straight jacket with 108 brackets
and a strap the wraps twice around my back then they latch it
cut ya fuckin head off and ask where you headed off to?
get it headed off too?
medice this headaches awful, this anistetics pathetic so is the diabetic waffel
and this prostetic arm keep crushin my hard taco
[Chorus]
Here comes the rain and thunder now
Nowhere to run, to run to now
I’ve disappeared, don’t wonder how
Looking for me
I'm underground
Here comes the rain and thunder now
Nowhere to run, to run to now
I’ve disappeared, don’t wonder how
Looking for me

The Way I Am,Curtain Call: The Hits [Deluxe Edition],2005,"Whatever..
Dre, just let it run
Aiyyo turn the beat up a little bit
Aiyyo.. this song is for anyone.. fuck it
Just shut up and listen, aiyyo..
I sit back with this pack of Zig Zags and this bag
of this weed it gives me the shit needed to be
the most meanest Mc on this Earth
And since birth I've been cursed with this curse to just curse
And just blurt this berserk and bizarre shit that works
And it sells and it helps in itself to relieve
all this tension dispensin these sentences
Gettin this stress that's been eatin me recently off of this chest
and I rest again peacefully (peacefully)..
but at least have the decency in you
to leave me alone, when you freaks see me out
in the streets when I'm eatin or feedin my daughter
do not come and speak to me (speak to me)..
I don't know you and no,
I don't owe you a mo-therfuck-in thing
I'm not Mr. N'Sync, I'm not what your friends think
I'm not Mr. Friendly, I can be a prick
if you tempt me my tank is on empty (is on empty)..
No patience is in me and if you offend me
I'm liftin you 10 feet (liftin you 10 feet).. in the air
I don't care who is there and who saw me destroy you
Go call you a lawyer, file you a lawsuit
I'll smile in the courtroom and buy you a wardrobe
I'm tired of all you (of all you)..
I don't mean to be mean but that's all I can be is just me
Chorus: And I am, whatever you say I am
If I wasn't, then why would I say I am?

Radio won't even play my jam
Cause I am, whatever you say I am
If I wasn't, then why would I say I am?
In the paper, the news everyday I am
I don't know, it's just the way I am
Sometimes I just feel like my father, I hate to be bothered
with all of this nonsense it's constant
And, ""Oh, it's his lyrical content -
- the song 'Guilty Conscience' has gotten such rotten responses""
And all of this controversy circles me
and it seems like the media immediately
points a finger at me (finger at me)..
So I point one back at 'em, but not the index or pinkie
or the ring or the thumb, it's the one you put up
when you don't give a fuck, when you won't just put up
with the bullshit they pull, cause they full of shit too
When a dude's gettin bullied and shoots up his school
and they blame it on Marilyn (on Marilyn).. and the heroin
Where were the parents at? And look where it's at
Middle America, now it's a tragedy
Now it's so sad to see, an upper class ci-ty
havin this happenin (this happenin)..
then attack Eminem cause I rap this way (rap this way)..
But I'm glad cause they feed me the fuel that I need for the fire
to burn and it's burnin and I have returned
Chorus:And I am, whatever you say I am.
If I wasn't then why would I say I am?
In the paper, the news, everyday I am.

Cause I am, whatever you say I am.
If I wasn't, then why would I say I am?
In the paper, the news, everyday I am.
I don't know, it's just the way I am.
I'm so sick and tired of bein admired
that I wish that I would just die or get fired
and dropped from my label and stop with the fables
I'm not gonna be able to top on ""My Name is..""
And pigeon-holed into some pop-py sensation
to cop me rotation at rock'n'roll stations
And I just do not got the patience (got the patience)..
to deal with these cocky caucasians who think
I'm some wigger who just tries to be black cause I talk
with an accent, and grab on my balls, so they always keep askin
the same fuckin questions (fuckin questions)..
What school did I go to, what hood I grew up in
The why, the who what when, the where, and the how
'til I'm grabbin my hair and I'm tearin it out
cause they drivin me crazy (drivin me crazy).. I can't take it
I'm racin, I'm pacin, I stand and I sit
And I'm thankful for ev-ery fan that I get
But I can't take a Shit, in the bathroom
without someone standin by it
No I won't sign your autograph
You can call me an asshole I'm glad

I've felt like I'm someone else

the top bunk with a belt
Got pissed off

The one problem was my English teacher was a guy
I smacked him in his face with an eraser,
chased him with a stapler
and stapled his nuts to a stack of papers

Flashed the bartender,

Make a record about doin drugs
and name it after her (Oh thank you!)

rush your stands
and try to touch your hands

The morning rain clouds up my window..
And I can't see at all
And even if I could it'll all be gray,
But your picture on my wall
It reminds me, that it's not so bad, it's not so bad..
Dear slim, I wrote but you still ain't callin
I left my cell, my pager,
and my home phone at the Bottom
I sent two letters back in autumn, you must not-a got 'em
There probably was a problem at the post office or somethin
Sometimes I scribble addresses too sloppy when I jot 'em
But anyways; fuck it, what's been up?
man how's your daughter?
My girlfriend's pregnant too, I'm bout to be a father
If I have a daughter, guess what I'ma call her?
I'ma name her bonnie
I read about your uncle ronnie too I'm sorry
I had a friend kill himself over some bitch
who didn't want him
I know you probably hear this everyday, but I'm your
Biggest fan
I even got the underground shit that you did with skam
I got a room full of your posters and your pictures man
I like the shit you did with rawkus too,
that shit was fat
Anyways, I hope you get this man, hit me back,
Just to chat, truly yours, your biggest fan
This is stan
My tea's gone cold I'm wondering why I..
Got out of bed at all
The morning rain clouds up my window..
And I can't see at all
And even if I could it'll all be gray,
But your picture on my wall
It reminds me, that it's not so bad, it's not so bad..
Dear slim, you still ain't called or wrote,
I hope you have a Chance
I ain't mad - I just think it's fucked up you don't
Answer fans
If you didn't wanna talk to me outside your concert
You didn't have to,
but you coulda signed an autograph for Matthew
That's my little brother man, he's only six years old
We waited in the blistering cold for you,
Four hours and you just said, ""no.""
That's pretty shitty man - you're like his fuckin idol
He wants to be just like you man,
he likes you more than I do
I ain't that mad though,
I just don't like bein Lied to
Remember when we met in denver -
you said if I'd write you
You would write back -
see I'm just like you in a way
I never knew my father neither;
He used to always cheat on my mom and beat her
I can relate to what you're saying in your songs
So when I have a shitty day,
I drift away and Put 'em on
Cause I don't really got shit else
so that shit helps When I'm depressed
I even got a tattoo of your name across the chest
Sometimes I even cut myself to see how much it bleeds
It's like adrenaline,
the pain is such a sudden rush for me
See everything you say is real,
and I respect you cause You tell it
My girlfriend's jealous cause I talk about you 24/7
But she don't know you like I know you slim,
No one does
She don't know what it was like for people like us growin up
You gotta call me man,
I'll be the biggest fan you'll ever lose
Sincerely yours, stan -- p.s.
We should be together too
My tea's gone cold I'm wondering why I..
Got out of bed at all
The morning rain clouds up my window..
And I can't see at all
And even if I could it'll all be gray,
But your picture on my wall
It reminds me, that it's not so bad, it's not so bad..
Dear mister-I'm-too-good-to-call-or-write-my-fans,
This'll be the last package I ever send your ass
It's been six months and still no word - I don't deserve it?
I know you got my last two letters;
I wrote the addresses on 'em perfect
So this is my cassette I'm sending you,
I hope you hear it
I'm in the car right now, I'm doing 90 on the freeway
Hey slim, I drank a fifth of vodka, you dare me to drive?
You know the song by phil collins,
""in the air of the night""
About that guy who coulda saved that other
Guy from drowning
But didn't, then phil saw it all, then at a a show he found him?
That's kinda how this is, you coulda rescued
Me from drowning
Now it's too late - I'm on a 1000 downers now,
I'm drowsy
And all I wanted was a lousy letter or a call
I hope you know I ripped all of your pictures off the wall
I love you slim, we coulda been together, think about it
You ruined it now, I hope you can't
Sleep and you dream about it
And when you dream
I hope you can't sleep and you scream about it
I hope your conscience eats at you and you
Can't breathe without me
See slim; [*screaming*] shut up bitch!
I'm tryin to talk!
Hey slim, that's my girlfriend screamin in the trunk
But I didn't slit her throat, I just tied her up, see
I ain't like you
Cause if she suffocates she'll suffer more,
and then she'll die too
Well, gotta go, I'm almost at the bridge now
Oh shit, I forgot, how'm I supposed to send this shit out?
My tea's gone cold I'm wondering why I..
Got out of bed at all
The morning rain clouds up my window..
And I can't see at all
And even if I could it'll all be gray,
But your picture on my wall
It reminds me, that it's not so bad, it's not so bad..
Dear stan, I meant to write you sooner but I just been busy
You said your girlfriend's pregnant now, how far along is she?
Look, I'm really flattered you would call your
Daughter that
And here's an autograph for your brother,
I wrote it on the starter cap
I'm sorry I didn't see you at the show,
I musta missed you
Don't think I did that shit intentionally just to diss you
But what's this shit you said about you like to cut
Your wrists too?
I say that shit just clownin dogg,
C'mon - how fucked up is you?
You got some issues stan, I think you need
Some counseling
To help your ass from bouncing off the walls when
You get down some
And what's this shit about us meant to be together?
That type of shit'll make me not want us
To meet each other
I really think you and your girlfriend need each other
Or maybe you just need to treat her better
I hope you get to read this letter,
I just hope it reaches you in time
before you hurt yourself,
I think that you'll be doin just fine
If you relax a little, I'm glad I inspire you but stan
Why are you so mad?
Try to understand, that I do want you as a fan
I just don't want you to do some crazy shit
I seen this one shit on the news a couple weeks ago that
Made me sick
Some dude was drunk and drove his car over a bridge
And had his girlfriend in the trunk, and she was pregnant
With his kid
And in the car they found a tape, but they didn't say
Who it was to
Come to think about, his name was.. it was you
Damn!"
Lose Yourself,Curtain Call: The Hits [Deluxe Edition],2005,"Look, if you had one shot
Or one opportunity
To seize everything you ever wanted
One moment
Would you capture it, or just let it slip? Yo
His palms are sweaty
Knees weak, arms are heavy
There's vomit on his sweater already
Mom's spaghetti, he's nervous
But on the surface he looks calm
And ready to drop bombs
But he keeps on forgetting what he wrote down
The whole crowd goes so loud
He opens his mouth but the words won't come out
He's choking, how?
Everybody's jokin' now
The clock's run out, time's up, over Blow!
Snap back to reality
Oh there goes gravity
Oh there goes Rabbit, he choked, he's so mad
But he won't, give up that easy, no
He won't have it
He knows his whole back's to these ropes
It don't matter, he's dope, he knows that
But he's broke, he's so sad that he knows
When he goes back to this mobile home
That's when it's back to the lab again, yo
This whole rhapsody
He better go capture this moment
And hope it don't pass him
You better lose yourself in the music
The moment that you own it
you better never let it go
You only get one shot
Do not miss your chance to blow
'Cause opportunity comes once in a lifetime go
You better lose yourself in the music
The moment that you own it
you better never let it go
You only get one shot
Do not miss your chance to blow
'Cause opportunity comes once in a lifetime, yo
You better
Soul's escapin'
Through this hole that is gaping
This world is mine for the taking
Make me king
As we move toward a new world order
A normal life is boring
But superstardom's close to post mortem
It only grows harder
Homie grows hotter
He blows us all over
These hoes is all on him
Coast to coast shows
He's known as the Globetrotter
Lonely roads
God only knows
He's grown farther from home, he's no father
He goes home and barely knows his own daughter
But hold ya nose
'Cause here goes the cold water
These hoes don't want him no mo'
He's cold product
And they moved on to the next schmoe who flows
And he knows dove and sold nada
And so the soap opera is told and unfolds
I suppose it's old partner, but the beat goes on
Da da dum da dum da da
You better lose yourself in the music
The moment that you own it
you better never let it go, oh
You only get one shot
Do not miss your chance to blow
'Cause opportunity comes once in a lifetime go
You better lose yourself in the music
The moment that you own it
you better never let it go, oh
You only get one shot
Do not miss your chance to blow
'Cause opportunity comes once in a lifetime, yo
You better
No more games
I'ma change what you call rage
Tear this muthafuckin' roof off
Like two dogs caged
I was playin' in the beginnin'
The mood all changed
I've been chewed up and spit out
And booed off stage
But I kept rhymin'
And stepwritin' the next cipher
Best believe somebody's payin' the pied piper
All the pain inside amplified by the
Fact that I can't get by with my nine to five
And I can't provide the right type of
Life for my family 'cause man
These Goddamn food stamps don't buy diapers
And there's no movie, there's no Mekhi Phifer
This is my life and these times are so hard
And it's gettin' even harder
Tryin' to feed and water my seed
Plus teeter-totter
Caught up between bein' a father and a primadonna
Baby momma drama, screamin' on her
Too much for me to wanna stay in one spot
Another day of monotony
Has gotten me to the point I'm like a snail
I've got to formulate a plot
'Fore end up in jail or shot
Success is my only muthafuckin' option
Failure's not
Mom I love you but this trailer's got to go
I cannot grow old in Salem's Lot
So here I go, it's my shot
Feet fail me not
'Cause maybe the only opportunity that I got
You better
Lose yourself in the music
The moment that you own it
you better never let it go, oh
You only get one shot
Do not miss your chance to blow
'Cause opportunity comes once in a lifetime go
You better lose yourself in the music
The moment that you own it
you better never let it go, oh
You only get one shot
Do not miss your chance to blow
'Cause opportunity comes once in a lifetime, yo
You better
You can do anything if you set your mind to man"

Shady, Aftermath
There she goes, shaking that ass on the floor
Bumpin' and grindin' that pole
The way she's grindin' that pole
I think I'm losing control
Get buzzed, get drunk, get crunked, get fuucked up
Hit the strip club don't forget once get your dick rubbed
Get fucked, get sucked, get wasted, shit faceted
Pasted, blasted, puke drink up, get a new drink
Hit the bathroom sink, throw up
Wipe your shoe clean, got a routine
Knowin' still got a few chunks on your shoestring
Knowin' I was dehydrated till the beat vibrated
I was revibed as soon as this B is gyrated
And hips and licked them lips and that was it
I had to get Nate Dogg and his sing some shit
[Nate Dogg]
Two to the one from the one to the three
I like good pussy and I like good trees
Smoke so much weed you wouldn't believe
And I get more ass than a toilet seat
Three to the one from the one to the three
I met a bad bitch last night in the D
Let me tell you how I made her leave with me
Conversation and Hennessey
I've been to the motherfuckin' mountain top
Heard motherfuckers talk, seen and dropped
If I ain't got a weapon I'ma pick up a rock
And when I bust yo ass I'ma continue to rock
Getcha ass of the wall with your two left feet
It's real easy just follow the beat
Don't let that fine girl pass you by
Look real close 'cause strobe lights blind
We 'bout to have a party (turn the music up)
Let's get it started (Go head shake your butt)
I'm lookin' for a girl with a body and a sexy strut
Wanna get it poppin' baby step right up
Some girls they act retarded
Some girls are 'bout it 'bout it
I'm lookin' for a girl that will do whatever the fuck
I say everyday she be givin' it up
CHORUS [Nate Dogg]
Shake that ass for me, shake that ass for me
Come on girl, shake that ass for me, shake that ass for me
Ohh girl, shake that ass for me, shake that ass for me
Come on girl, shake that ass for me, shake that ass for me
[Eminem]
I'm a menace, a dentist, an oral hygienist
Open your mouth for about four or five minutes
Take a little bit of this fluoride rinse
Swish but don't spit it, swallow and I'll finish
Yeah me and Nate d-o double g
Looking for a couple bitches with some double d's
Pop a little champagne and a couple E's
Slip it in her bubbuly, we finna finna have a party
[Nate Dogg]
Have a party (turn the music up)
Let's get it started (Go head shake your butt)
I'm lookin' for a girl I can fuck in my hummer truck
Apple Bottom jeans and a big old slut
Some girls they act retarded
Some girls are 'bout it 'bout it
I want a bitch that sit at the crib with no panties on
Knows that she can't but she won't say no
Now look at this lady all in front of me, sexy as can be
Tonight I want a slut, will you be mine?
I heard you was freaky from a friend of mine
[Eminem]
Now I'ma hope you don't get mad at me
But I told Nate you was a freak
He said he wants a slut, hope you don't mind
I told him that you like it from behind

Sing For The Moment,Curtain Call: The Hits [Deluxe Edition],2005,"[Verse 1]
These ideas are nightmares to white parents
Whose worst fear is a child with dyed hair
And who likes earrings
Like whatever they say has no bearing,
it's so scary
In a house that allows no swearing
To see him walking around with his headphones blaring
Alone in his own zone, cold and he don't care
He's a problem child
And what bothers him all comes out, when he talks about
His fuckin' dad walkin' out
'Cause he just hates him so bad that he blocks him out
If he ever saw him again he'd probably knock him out
His thoughts are whacked,
he's mad so he's talkin' back
Talkin' black, brainwashed from rock and rap
He sags his pants, do-rags and a stocking cap
His step-father hit him, so he socked him back,
and broke his nose
His house is a broken home,
there's no control,
he just let's his emotions go...
[Chorus]
{C'mon}, sing with me, {sing}, sing for the years
{Sing it}, sing for the laughter, sing for the tears, {c'mon)
Sing it with me, just for today,
Maybe tomorrow the good Lord will take you away...
[Verse 2]
Entertainment is changin', intertwinin' with gangsta's
In the land of the killers, a sinner's mind is a sanctum
Holy or unholy, only have one homie
Only this gun, lonely cause don't anyone know me
Yet everybody just feels like they can relate,
I guess words are a mothafucka
They can be great or they can degrade,
Or even worse they can teach hate
It's like these kids hang on every single statement we make
Like they worship us,
Plus all the stores ship us platinum
Now how the fuck did this metamorphosis happen
From standin' on corners and porches just rappin'
To havin' a fortune, no more kissin' ass
But then these critics crucify you,
journalists try to burn you
Fans turn on you,
attorneys all want a turn at you
To get they hands on every dime you have,
They want you to lose your mind every time you mad
So they can try to make you out to look like a loose cannon
Any dispute won't hesitate to produce handguns
That's why these prosecutors wanna convict me,
Strictly just to get me off of these streets quickly
But all their kids be listenin' to me religiously,
So I'm signin' cd's while police fingerprint me
They're for the judge's daughter but his grudge is against me
If I'm such a fuckin' menace, this shit doesn't make sense Pete
It's all political,
If my music is literal, and I'm a criminal
How the fuck can I raise a little girl
I couldn't, I wouldn't be fit to
You're full of shit too, Guerrera,
that was a fist that hit you...
[Chorus]
[Verse 3]
They say music can alter moods and talk to you
Well can it load a gun up for you, and cock it too?
Well if it can, then the next time you assault a dude
Just tell the judge it was my fault and I'll get sued
See what these kids do is hear about us totin' pistols
And they want to get one cause they think the shit's cool
Not knowin' we really just protectin' ourselves,
We entertainers!
Of course the shit's affectin' our sales, you ignoramus!
But music is reflection of self, we just explain it,
And then we get our checks in the mail
It's fucked up, ain't it?
How we can come from practically nothing
to being able to have any fuckin' thing that we wanted
That's why we sing for these kids, who don't have a thing
Except for a dream, and a fuckin' rap magazine
Who post pin-up pictures on their walls all day long
Idolize they favorite rappers and know all they songs
Or for anyone who's ever been through shit in their lives
Till they sit and they cry at night wishin' they'd die
Till they throw on a rap record and they sit, and they vibe
We're nothin' to you but we're the fuckin' shit in they eyes
That's why we seize the moment
Try to freeze it and own it,
squeeze it and hold it
Cause we consider these minutes golden
And maybe they'll admit it when we're gone
Just let our spirits live on
through our lyrics that you hear in our songs and we can..."

Guess who's back, back again
Shady's back, tell a friend
Guess who's back, guess who's back,
guess who's back, guess who's back,
guess who's back, guess who's back,
guess who's back...
(Nah nah nah nah nah na na nah) 2x
I've created a monster, cuz nobody wants to
See Marshall no more they want Shady
I'm chopped liver
Well if you want Shady, this is what I'll give ya
A little bit of weed
mixed with some hard liquor
Some vodka that'll jumpstart my heart quicker
Then a shock when I get shocked at the hospital
By the Dr. when I'm not co-operating
When I'm rocking the table
while he's operating (Hey!)
You waited this long now stop debating
Cuz I'm back, I'm on the rag and ovulating
I know that you got a job Ms. Cheney
But your husbands heart problem is complicating
So the FCC won't let me be
Or let me be me so let me see
They've tried to shut me down on MTV
But it feels so empty without me
So, come on dip, bum on your lips
fuck that,
Cum on your lips & some on your tits
And get ready cuz this shit's about to get heavy
I just settled all my lawsuits,
""Fuck you Debbie!""
Now this looks like a job for me
So everybody just follow me
Cuz we need a little controversy,
Cuz it feels so empty without me.
I said this looks like a job for me
So everybody just follow me
Cuz we need a little controversy,
Cuz it feels so empty without me.
Little hellions, kids feeling rebellious
Embarrassed, their parents still listen to Elvis
They start feeling like prisoners helpless,
Til someone comes along on a mission and yells ""bitch""
A visionary, vision of scary, could start a revolution,
Pollutin' the air waves a rebel
So just let me revel and bask,
In the fact that I got everyone kissing my ass
And it's a disaster such a catastrophe
For you to see so damn much of my ass
you ask for me?
Well I'm back (da-da-na-na-da-nanana)
fix your bent antenna
Tune it in and then I'm gonna enter
In up under your skin like a splinter
The center of attention back for the winter
I'm interesting, the best thing since wrestling
Infesting in your kids ears and nesting
(announcer voice)
Testing ""Attention Please""
Feel the tension soon as someone mentions me
Here's my 10 cents my 2 cents is free
A nuisance, who sent, you sent for me?
Now this looks like a job for me
So everybody just follow me
Cuz we need a little controversy,
Cuz it feels so empty without me.
I said this looks like a job for me
So everybody just follow me
Cuz we need a little controversy,
Cuz it feels so empty without me.
A tisk-it a task-it,
I go tit for tat with anybody who's talking this shit that shit
Chris Kirkpatrick, you can get your ass kicked
Worse than them little Limp Bizkit bastards,
And Moby, you can get stomped by Obie,
You 36 year old bald headed fag blow me
You don't know me, you're too old
Let go, it's over, nobody listens to techno
Now let go, just give me the signal
I will be there with a whole list full of new insults
I've been dope, suspenseful with a pencil
Ever since Prince turned himself into a symbol
But sometimes the shit just seems,
Everybody only wants to discuss me
So this must mean I'm disgusting,
But its just me I'm just obscene
Though I'm not the first king of controversy
I am the worst thing since Elvis Presley,
To do Black Music so selfishly
And use it to get myself wealthy (Hey)
Here's a concept that works
20 million other white rappers emerge
But no matter how many fish in the sea
It'll be so empty without me.
Now this looks like a job for me
So everybody just follow me
Cuz we need a little controversy,
Cuz it feels so empty without me.
I said this looks like a job for me
So everybody just follow me

Like Toy Soldiers,Curtain Call: The Hits [Deluxe Edition],2005,"Step by step, heart to heart,
left right left
We all fall down
Chorus
Step by step, heart to heart,
left right left
We all fall to down, like toy soldiers
Bit by bit, torn apart, we never win
But the battle wages on, for toy soldiers
I'm suppose to be the soldier
who never blows his composure
Even though I hold the weight
of the whole world on my shoulders
I ain't never suppose to show it,
my crew ain't suppose to know it
But if it means going toe to toe with the Benzino,
it don't matter I'd never drag 'em in battles
that I can handle 'less I absolutely have to
I'm suppose to set an example, I need to be the leader
My crew looks for me to guide 'em
If some shit ever just pop off I'm suppose to be beside 'em
Now Ja said I tried to squash it,
it was too late to stop it
There's a certain line you just don't cross
and he crossed it
I heard him say Hailie's name on a song
and I just lost it
It was crazy, this shit be way
beyond some Jay-Z and Nas shit
And even though the battle was won, I feel like we lost it
I spent too much energy on it, honestly I'm exhausted
And I'm so caught in it
I almost feel I'm the one who caused it
This ain't what I'm in hip hop for, it's not why I got in it
That was never my object for someone to get killed
Why would I wanna destroy something I help build
It wasn't my intentions, my intentions were good
I went through my whole career
without ever mentionin' [Suge]
Now it's just out of respect, for not runnin' my mouth
And talkin' about something that I knew nothing about
Plus Dre told me stay out, this just wasn't my beef
So I did, I just fell back,
watched and gritted my teeth
While he's all over Tv,
down talkin' a man who literally saved my life
Like ""fuck it I understand"" this is business
And this shit just isn't none of my business
But still knowin' this shit could pop off
at any minute 'cause...
Chorus
Step by step, heart to heart,
left right left
We all fall down, like toy soldiers
Bit by bit, torn apart, we never win
But the battle wages on, for toy soldiers
There used to be a time when,
you could just say a rhyme
And wouldn't have to worry about
one of your people dyin'
But now it's elevated 'cause
once you put someone's kids in it
The shit gets escalated, it ain't just words no more is it?
It's a different ball game callin' names
and you ain't just rappin'
We actually tried to stop the 50 and Ja beef from happenin'
Me and Dre had sat with him, kicked it
and had a chat with him
And asked him not to start it
he wasn't gonna go after him
Until Ja started yappin' in magazines
how we stabbed him
Fuck it 50 smash 'em, mash 'em and let him have it
Meanwhile my attention is pullin' in other directions
Some receptionist at The Source
who answers phones at his desk
has an erection for me
and thinks that I'll be his resurrection
Tries to blow the dust off his mic and make a new record
But now he's fucked the game up
'cause one of the ways I came up
Was through that publication
the same one that made me famous
Now the owner of it has got a grudge against me for nothin'
Well fuck it, that motherfucker could get it too,
fuck him then
But I'm so busy being pissed off
I don't stop to think
That we just inherited 50's beef with Murder Inc.
And he's inherited mine which is fine
ain't like either of us mind
We still have soldiers that's on the front line
That's willing to die for us,
as soon as we give the orders
Never to extort us, strictly to show they support us
We'll maybe shout 'em out in a rap or up in a chorus
To show them we love 'em back
and let 'em know how important it is
to have Runyon Avenue soldiers up in our corners
Their loyalty to us is worth more than any award is
But I ain't tryna have none of my people hurt and murdered,
it ain't worth it
I can't think of a perfecter way to word it
Then to just say that I love y'all too much to see the verdict
I'll walk away from it all
'fore I let it go any further
But don't get it twisted,
it's not a plea that I'm coppin'
I'm just willin' to be the bigger man
If y'all can quit poppin' off at your jaws with the knockin'
'cause frankly I'm sick of talkin'
I'm not gonna let someone else's coffin
rest on my conscience 'cause...

Jaws all on the floor
Like Pam and Tommy just burst in the door
And started whoopin her ass worse than before
They first were divorced
Throwing her over furniture (aah)
It's the return of the
""ah wait, no wait, you're kidding
He didn't just say what I think he did
Did he? ""
And Dr. Dre said
Nothing you idiots, Dr Dre's dead
He's locked in my bassment
Feminist women love eminem
Chicka chicka chicka slim shady
""I'm sick of him, look at him
Walkin around, grabbin his you know what
Flippin' to you know who""
""yeah, but he's so cute though""
Yeah, I probably got a couple of screws up in my head loose
But no worse than what's
goin on in your parents bedroom (eheheheh)
Sometimes, I wanna get on TV and just let loose
But can't, but it's cool for Tom Green
to hump a dead moose
My bum is on your lips
My bum is on your lips
And if I'm lucky, you might just give it a little kiss
And that's the message that we deliver to little kids
And expect them not to know
what a woman's clitoris is
Of course they're gonna know what intercourse is
By the time they hit 4th grade
They got the discovery channel, dont they?
We ain't nothing but mammals
Well, some of us cannibals
Who cut other people open like cantelopes
But if we can hump dead animals and antelopes
Then there's no reason that a man
And another man can't elope
But if you feel like I feel
I got the antedote
Women wave your pantehose
Sing the chorus and it goes
I'm Slim Shady, yes, I'm the real Shady
All you other Slim Shadys are just imitating
So wont the real Slim Shady please stand up
Please stand up, please stand up
Cause I'm Slim Shady, yes, I'm the real Shady
All you other Slim Shadys are just imitating
So wont the real Slim Shady please stand up
Please stand up, please stand up
Will Smith don't got to cuss in his raps to sell records
Well I do, so fuck him and fuck you too
You think I give a damn about a grammy
Half of you critics can't even stomach me
Let alone stand me
""but slim, what if you win, wouldn't it be weird""
Why? so you guys can just lie to get me here
So you can sit me here next to Britney Spears
Bullshit, Christina Aguilera better switch me chairs
So I can sit next to Carson Daly and Fred Durst
And hear em argue over who she gave head to first
Little bitch, put me on blast on MTV
""yeah, he's cute
But I think he's married to Kim, hee hee""
I should download her audio on MP3
And show the world
how you gave eminem VD (aah)
I'm sick of you little girl and boy groups
All you do is annoy me
So I have N'SYNC here to destroy you
And there's a million of us just like me
Who cuss like me
Who just don't give a fuck like me
Who dress like me, walk, talk
And act like me
And just might be the next best thing, but not quite me
I'm Slim Shady, yes, I'm the real Shady
All you other Slim Shadys are just imitating
So won't the real Slim Shady please stand up
Please stand up, please stand up
Cause I'm Slim Shady, yes, I'm the real Shady
All you other Slim Shadys are just imitating
So wont the real Slim Shady please stand up
Please stand up, please stand up
I'm like a head trip to listen to
Cause I'm only giving you things
You joke about with your friends inside you livin' room
The only difference is I got the balls to say it
In front of ya'll and I aint gotta be false or sugar coated at all
I just get on the mic and spit it
And whether you like to admit it (riip)
I just shitted it better than 90 you rappers out can
Then you wonder how can
Kids eat up these albums
Like valiums
It's funny, cause at the rate I'm going
When I'm thirty
I'll be the only person in the nursing home flirting
Pinchin nurses asses
When I'm jackin off with jergen's
And I'm jerkin' but this whole bag of viagra
Isn't working
In every single person there's a slim shady lurkin
He could be workin at burger king
Spittin on your onion rings
Or in the parking lot, circling, screamin
I dont give a fuck
With his windows down and his system up
So will the real shady please stand up
And put 1 of those fingers on each hand up
And be proud to be outta your mind and outta control
And 1 more time, loud as you can, how does it go?
I'm Slim Shady, yes, I'm the real Shady
All you other Slim Shadys are just imitating
So wont the real Slim Shady please stand up
Please stand up, please stand up
Cause I'm Slim Shady, yes, I'm the real Shady
All you other Slim Shadys are just imitating
So wont the real Slim Shady please stand up
Please stand up, please stand up
Cause I'm Slim Shady, yes, I'm the real Shady

Haha guess it's a slim shady in all of us
Fuck it let's all stand up"
Mockingbird,Curtain Call: The Hits [Deluxe Edition],2005,"Yeah
I know sometimes,
things may not always make sense to you right now
But hey, what'd daddy always tell you?
Straighten up little soldier
Stiffen up that upper lip
What you crying about?
You got me
Hailie, I know you miss your mom,
and I know you miss your dad
Well, I'm gone,
But I'm trying to give you the life that I never had
I can see you're sad, even when you smile,
even when you laugh
I can see it in your eyes,
deep inside you wanna cry
'cause you're scared, I ain't there?
Daddy's with you in your prayers
No more crying, wipe them tears
Daddy's here, no more nightmares
We gon' pull together through it,
we gon' do it
Laney, uncle's crazy, ain't he?
Yeah but he loves you girl and you better know it
We're all we got in this world
When it spins, when it swirls,
when it whirls, when it twirls
Two little beautiful girls
Lookin' puzzled, in a daze
I know it's confusing you
Daddy's always on the move,
mamma's always on the news
I try to keep you sheltered from it
but somehow it seems
the harder that I try to do that,
the more it backfires on me
All the things growing up his daddy
that he had to see
Daddy don't want you to see
but you see just as much as he did
We did not plan it to be this way,
your mother and me
But things have got so bad between us
I don't see us ever being together ever again
Like we used to be when we was teenagers
But then of course everything always happens for a reason
I guess it was never meant to be
But it's just something we have no control
over and that's what destiny is
But no more worries,
rest your head and go to sleep
Maybe one day we'll wake up
and this will all just be a dream
Chorus
Now hush little baby, don't you cry
Everything's gonna be alright
Stiffen that upper lip up little lady, I told ya
Daddy's here to hold ya through the night
I know mommy's not here right now and
we don't know why
We fear how we feel inside
It may seem a little crazy, pretty baby
But I promise, momma's gon' be alright
It's funny
I remember back one year
when daddy had no money
Mommy wrapped the Christmas presents up
and stuck 'em under the tree
and said some of 'em were from me
'cause daddy couldn't buy 'em
I'll never forget that Christmas
I sat up the whole night crying
'cause daddy felt like a bum,
see daddy had a job
But his job was to keep the food
on the table for you and mom
And at the time, every house that we lived in
either kept getting broke into and robbed
or shot up on the block and your mom
was saving money
for you in a jar
Tryna start a piggy bank for you
so you could go to college
Almost had a thousand dollars,
till someone broke in and stole it
And I know it hurt so bad
it broke your momma's heart
And it seemed like everything was just startin' to fall apart
Mom and dad was arguin' a lot
so momma moved back
on the Chalmers in the flat,
one bedroom apartment
And dad moved back to the other side
of 8 Mile on Novara
And that's when daddy went to California with his Cd
and met Dr. Dre
And flew you and momma out to see me
But daddy had to work,
you and momma had to leave me
Then you started seeing daddy on the T.V.,
and momma didn't like it
And you and Laney were too young to understand it
Papa was a rollin' stone, momma developed a habit
And it all happened too fast
for either one of us to grab it
I'm just sorry you were there and
had to witness it first hand
'cause all I ever wanted to do was just make you proud
Now I'm sittin' in this empty house, just reminiscing
Lookin' at your baby pictures, it just trips me out
to see how much you both have grown,
it's almost like you're sisters now
Wow, guess you pretty much are and daddy's still here
Laney I'm talkin' to you too,
daddy's still here
I like the sound of that, yeah
It's got a ring to it don't it?
Shh, momma's only gone for the moment
Chorus
Now hush little baby, don't you cry
Everything's gonna be alright
Stiffen that upper lip up little lady, I told ya
Daddy's here to hold ya through the night
I know mommy's not here right now and
we don't know why
We fear how we feel inside
It may seem a little crazy, pretty baby
But I promise, momma's gon' be alright
And if you ask me too
Daddy's gonna buy you a mockingbird
I'ma give you the world
I'ma buy a diamond ring for you
I'ma sing for you
I'll do anything for you to see you smile
And if that mockingbird don't sing
and that ring don't shine
I'ma break that bird's neck
I'd go back to the jeweler who sold it to ya
And make him eat every carat
Don't fuck with dad (haha)"
Guilty Conscience ,Curtain Call: The Hits [Deluxe Edition],2005,"Announcer:
Meet Eddie, 23 years old.
Fed up with life,
and the way things are going,
he decides to rob a liquor store
(I can't take this no more, I can't take it no more, homes)
But on his way in,
he has a sudden change of heart.
And suddenly,
his conscience comes into play
(Shit is mine, I gotta do this...gotta do this)
Dr. Dre: Alright, stop! (Huh?)
Now before you walk in the door
Of this liquor store
And try to get money out the drawer
You'd better think of the consequence (But who are you?)
I'm your motherfuckin' conscience
Eminem: That nonsense.
Go in and gaffle the money,
and run to one of your aunt's cribs.
And borrow her damn dress
And one of her blonde wigs.
Tell her you need a place to stay
You'll be safe for days
If you shave your legs
With Rene's razor blade
Dr. Dre: Yeah, but if it all goes through
Like it's supposed to
The whole neighbourhood knows you
And they'll expose you.
Think about before you walk in the door first.
Look at the store clerk,
She's older then George Burns.
Eminem: Fuck that.
Do that shit.
Shoot that bitch
Can you afford to blow this shit?
Are you that rich?
Why you give a fuck if she dies?
Are you that bitch?
You really think *she* gives a fuck
If you have kids?
Dr. Dre: Man, don't do it.
It's not worth it
To risk it. (You're right)
Not over this shit. (Stop)
Drop the biscuit. (I will)
Don't even listen to Slim, yo.
He's bad for you. (Eminem: You know what, Dre?
I don't like your attitude.)
[sound of static]
(""It's all right, c'mon, just come in here for a minute"")
(""Mmm, I don't know"")
(""Look, baby..."")
(""Damn!"")
(""Yo, it's gonna be all right, right?"")
(""Well, okay..."")
Announcer:
Meet Stan, 21 years old (Give me a kiss)
After meeting a young girl at a rave party,
thing's start getting hot and heavy in an upstairs bedroom.
Once again, his conscience comes into play...(Shit!)
Eminem: Now listen to me.
While you're kissin' her cheek
And smearin' her lipstick, slip this in her drink.
Now all you gotta do is nibble on this little bitch's earlobe...
(Dr. Dre: Yo, this girl's only 15 years old.
You shouldn't take advantage of her,
That's not fair.)
Yo, look at her bush...Does it got hair? (Uh-huh.)
Fuck this bitch right here on the spot bare.
'Till she passes out
And she forgot how she got there.
(Dr. Dre: Man, ain't you ever seen that one movie Kids?)
No, but I seen a porno with some Sundoobiest!.
(Dr. Dre: Shit, you wanna get hauled off to jail?)
Man, fuck that,
Hit that shit raw dawg and bail...

Announcer:
Meet Grady, a 29 year-old construction worker.
After coming home from a hard day's work,
He walks in the door of his trailer park home
To find his wife in bed with another man.
(Grady:What The Fuck?!?!)
Dr. Dre: Alright, calm down.
Relax, start breathin'...
Eminem: Fuck that shit.
You just caught this bitch cheatin'.
While you at work, she's with some dude
Tryin' to get off?
Fuck slittin' her throat!
Cut This Bitche'S Head Off!!!
Dr Dre: Wait, What if there's an explanation for this shit.
(Eminem: What? She tripped? Fell? Landed on his dick?!)
Alright, Shady.
Maybe he's right, Grady.
But think about the baby
Before you get all crazy.
Eminem: Okay! thought about it,
Still wanna stab her?
Grab her by the throat,
Get you're daughter and kidnap her?
That's what I did.
Be smart, don't be a retard.
You gonna take advice from somebody who slapped Dee Barnes?
Dr. Dre: What did you say?
(Eminem: What's wrong?
Didn't think I'd remember?)
I'ma kill you, motherfucker!
Eminem: Ah-ah,
Temper, temper!
Mr. Dre?
Mr. N.W.A?
Mr. Ak coming straight outta Compton
Y'all better make way?
How in the fuck you gonna tell this man not to be violent?
Dr. Dre: Cuz he don't need to go the same route that I went.
Been there, done that...Aw, fuck it...What am I sayin'?
Shoot 'em both, Grady, where's your gun at?

Cleanin' Out My Closet,Curtain Call: The Hits [Deluxe Edition],2005,"Where's my snare?
I have no snare on my headphones
There you go, yeah, yo yo
Have you ever been hated or discriminated against?
I have, I've been protested and demonstrated against
Picket signs for my wicked rhymes, look at the times
Sick as the mind of the motherfucking kid that's behind
All this commotion, emotions run deep as oceans explodin'
Tempers flarin' from parents just blow 'em off and keep goin'
Not takin' nothin' from no one, give 'em hell long as I'm breathin'
Keep kickin' ass in the mornin' and takin' names in the evenin'
Leaving with a taste as sour as vinegar in their mouth
See they can trigger me but they'll never figure me out
Look at me now, I betcha probably sick of me now
Ain't you mama? I 'ma make you look so ridiculous now
I'm sorry mama, I never meant to hurt you
I never meant to make you cry
But tonight, I'm cleanin' out my closet
One more time
I said, ""I'm sorry mama, I never meant to hurt you
I never meant to make you cry
But tonight I'm cleanin out my closet, ha""
I got some skeletons in my closet and I don't know if no one knows it
So before they throw me inside my coffin and close it
I'm a expose it, I'll take you back to '73
Before I ever had a multi-platinum sellin' CD
I was a baby maybe I was just a couple of months
My faggot father must've had his panties up in a bunch
'Cause he split, I wonder if he even kissed my goodbye
No I don't, on second thought I just fuckin' wished he would die
I look at Hailie and I couldn't picture leaving her side
Even if I hated Kim, I'd grit my teeth and I'd try to make it work wit her
At least for Hailie's sake, I maybe made some mistakes
But I'm only human but I'm man enough to face 'em today
What I did was stupid, no doubt it was dumb
But the smartest shit I did was take the bullets outta that gun
'Cause I'd of killed 'em, shit I would've shot Kim and them both
It's my life, I'd like to welcome y'all to the Eminem show
I'm sorry mama, I Never meant to hurt you
I Never meant to make you cry
But tonight, I'm cleanin' out my closet
One more time
I said, ""I'm sorry mama, I Never meant to hurt you
I Never meant to make you cry
But tonight I'm cleanin' out my closet, ha""
Now I would never diss my own mama just to get recognition
Take a second to listen 'fore you think this record is dissin'
But put yourself in my position, just try to envision
Witnessin' your mama poppin' prescription pills in the kitchen
Bitchin' that someone's always goin' through her purse and shit's missin'
Goin' through public housin' systems, victim of Munchausen's syndrome
My whole life I was made to believe I was sick when I wasn't
'Til I grew up, now I blew up it makes you sick to ya stomach, doesn't it?
Wasn't it the reason you made that CD for me, Ma?
So you could try to justify the way you treated me, Ma?
But guess what, ya gettin' older now and it's cold when yaw lonely
And Nathan's growin' up so quick he's going to know that you're phony
And Hailie's getting' so big now, you should see her, she's beautiful
But you'll never see her, she won't even be at your funeral
See what hurts me the most, is you won't admit you was wrong
Screw this song, keep tellin' yourself that you was a mom
But how dare you try to take what you didn't help me to get
You selfish bitch, I hope you fuckin' burn in Hell for this shit
Remember when Ronnie died and you said you wished it was me?
Well guess what, I am dead, dead to you as can be!
I'm sorry mama, I never meant to hurt you
I Never meant to make you cry
But tonight I'm cleanin' out my closet
One more time
I said, ""I'm sorry mama, I Never meant to hurt you
I never meant to make you cry
But tonight I'm cleanin' out my closet"""

You can try this at home
You can be just like me!
Mic check one two.. we recordin?
I'm cancerous, so when I diss you wouldn't wanna answer this
If you responded back with a battle rap you wrote for Canibus
I strangled you to death then I choked you again
Then break your fuckin legs till your bones poke through your skin
You beef wit me, I'ma even the score equally
Take you on Jerry Springer, and beat yer ass legally
I get you blunted off of funny home grown
Cause when I smoke out I hit the trees harder than Sonny Bono
(Ohh no!!) So if I said I never did drugs
That would mean I lie AND get fucked more than the President does
Hillary Clinton tried to slap me and call me a pervert
I ripped her fuckin tonsils out and fed her sherbet (Bitch!)
My nerves hurt, and lately I'm on edge
Grabbed Vanilla Ice and ripped out his blonde dreads (Fuck you!)
Every girl I ever went out wit is goin lez
Follow me and do exactly what the song says:
smoke weed, take pills, drop outta school, kill people and drink
And jump behind the wheel like it was still legal
I'm dumb enough to walk in a store and steal
So I'm dumb enough to ask for a date with Lauryn Hill
Some people only see that I'm white, ignorin skill
Cause I stand out like a green hat with a orange bill
But I don't get pissed, y'all don't even see through the mist
How the fuck can I be white, I don't even exist
I get a clean shave, bathe, go to a rave
Die from an overdose and dig myself up out of my grave
My middle finger won't go down, how do I wave?
And this is how I'm supposed to teach kids how to behave?
Now follow me and do exactly what you see
Don't you wanna grow up to be just like me!
I slap women and eat shrooms then O.D.
Now don't you wanna grow up to be just like me!
Me and Marcus Allen went over to see Nicole
When we heard a knock at the door, must have been Ron Gold'
Jumped behind the door, put the orgy on hold
Killed em both and smeared blood in a white Bronco (we did it!)
My mind won't work if my spine don't jerk
I slapped Garth Brooks out of his Rhinestone shirt
I'm not a player just a ill rhyme sayer
That'll spray an Aerosol can up at the ozone layer (psssssssh)
My rap style's warped, I'm runnin out the morgue
witcha dead grandmother's corpse to throw it on your porch
Jumped in a Chickenhawk cartoon wit a cape on
And beat up Foghorn Leghorn with an acorn
I'm bout as normal as Norman Bates, with deformative traits
A premature birth that was four minutes late
Mother.. are you there? I love you
I never meant to hit you over the head with that shovel
Will someone explain to my brain that I just severed
a main vein with a chainsaw and I'm in pain?
I take a breather and sighed; either I'm high, or I'm nuts
Cause if you ain't tiltin this room, neither am I
So when you see your mom with a thermometer shoved in her ass
Then it probably is obvious I got it on with her
Cause when I drop this solo shit it's over with
I bought Cage's tape, opened it, and dubbed over it
I came to the club drunk with a fake ID
Don't you wanna grow up to be just like me!
I've been with 10 women who got HIV
Now don't you wanna grow up to be just like me!
I got genital warts and it burns when I pee
Don't you wanna grow up to be just like me!

Guess who's back with a brand new rap
And I don't mean rap
as in a new case of child molestation accusation
Aah aah aah aah aah
No worries, poppa's got a brand new bag of toys
What else could I possibly do to make noise?
I done touched on everything, but little boys
That's not a stab at Michael
That's just a metaphor, I'm just psycho
I go a little bit crazy sometimes
I get a little bit out of control with my rhymes
Good God, dip, do a little slide
Bend down, touch your toes and just glide
Up the center of the dance floor
Like teepee from my bung hole in the school
if you let one go
Nobody's gonna know who'd hear it
Give a little ""poot poot"", it's ok {*Fart sound*}

Get the top down, let my hair blow
I don't know where I'm goin'
All I know is when I get there
someone's gonna ""touch my body""
Excuse me miss, I don't mean to sound like a jerk

Could you punch me in the stomach and pull my hair
Spit on me, maybe gouge my eyes out

It's my life
My own words I guess
Have you ever loved someone so much you'd give an arm for?
Not the expression, no, literally give an arm for?
When they know they are your heart
And you know you are their armour
And you will destroy anyone who will try to harm her
But what happens when karma turns right around and bites you
And everything you stand for turns on you to spite you
What happens when you become the main source of her pain

""Dad's gotta go catch a plane""
""Daddy where's mommy?
I can't find mommy, where is she?""

""This'll keep you safe daddy, take it with you""
I look up, it's just me standin' in the mirror,
these fuckin' walls must be talkin
coz man I can hear 'em
They sayin you got
one more chance to do right, and it's tonight,
Now go out there and show 'em that you love
'em 'fore its too late
And just as I go to walk out of my bedroom door
it turns to a stage,
they're gone
And the spotlight is on and I'm singin...
Refrão
And when I'm gone, just carry on don't mourn,
Rejoice every time you hear the sound of my voice
Just know that I'm lookin' down on you smiling
And I didn't feel a thing
so baby don't feel no pain,
just smile back
Sixty thousand people, all jumpin' out their seat
The curtain closes, they're throwing roses at my feet
I take a bow, ""and thank you all for comin' out""
They're screamin so loud,
I take one last look at the crowd
I glance down, I don't believe what I'm seein',
""Daddy it's me! Help mummy
her wrists are bleedin'""
But baby we're in Sweden,
how did you get to Sweden?!
""I followed you daddy, you told me that you wern't leavin
You lied to me dad,
and now you make mommy sad
And I bought you this coin
It says 'number 1 dad', that's all I wanted
I just wanna give you this coin
I get the point, fine, me and mommy are goin""
But baby wait-
""its too late dad, you made your choice.
Now go out there and show 'em
that you love 'em more than us
That's what they want
They want you Marshall,
they keep screamin your name,
it's no wonder you can't go to sleep
Just take another pill, yeah I bet ya you will
You rap about it. Yeah word, ke-keep it real""
I hear applause, all this time I couldn't see
How could it be that the curtain is closing on me
I turn around, find a gun on the ground, cock it,
put it to my brain, scream 'Die Shady!' and pop it
The sky darkens, my life flashes,
The plane that I was supposed to be on crashes
and burns to ashes
That's when I wake up, alarm clock's ringin',
There's birds singin', it's spring and
Hailie's out side swingin'
I walk right up to Kim and kiss her, tell her I miss her
Hailie just smiles and winks at her little sister,
almost as if to say-
Refrão
And when I'm gone, just carry on don't mourn,
Rejoice every time you hear the sound of my voice
Just know that I'm lookin' down on you smiling
And I didn't feel a thing
so baby don't feel no pain,
just smile back"

Disrespect me - my potency is deadly

Hit mummy in the tummy if the hooker plays a dummy
Slit the wrist of little sis
After she sucked the dick, I stabbed her brother with the icepick
because he wanted me to fuck him from the back
but Smalls don't get down like that
Got your father hidin in a room; fucked him with the broom
Slit him down the back and threw salt in the wound
Who you think you're dealin with?
Anybody step into my path is fuckin feelin it!
Hardcore, I got it sucked like a pussy
Stab ya til you're gushy, so please don't push.. me

Kill You,Curtain Call: The Hits [Deluxe Edition],2005,"[Eminem]
When I was just a little baby boy,
my momma used to tell me these crazy things.
She used to tell me my daddy was an evil man,
she used to tell me he hated me.
But then I got a little bit older and I realized,
she was the crazy one.
But there was nothin' I could do or say to try to change her,
cuz that's just the way she was.
They said I can't rap about bein' broke no more.
They say I can't rap about coke no more.
(Ahhh!) Slut, you think I won't choke no whore
'till the vocal cords don't work in her throat no more?!
(Ahhh!) These motherfuckers are thinkin' I'm playin'
Thinkin' I'm sayin' this shit cuz I'm thinkin' it just to be sayin' it
(Ahhh!) Put your hands down Bitch, I ain't gon' shoot you.
I'ma pull +You+ to this bullet, and put it through you
(Ahhh!) Shut up slut, you're causin' too much chaos
Just bend over and take it like a slut, okay Ma?
""Oh, now he's rapin' his own mother, abusing a whore,
snorting coke, and we gave him the Rolling Stone cover?""
You goddamn right Bitch, and now it's too late,
I'm triple platinum and tragedies happened in two states.
I invented violence, you vile venomous volatile bitches
vain Vicodin, vrinnn Vrinnn, Vrinnn! {*chainsaw revs up*}
Texas Chainsaw, left his brains all
Danglin' from his neck, while his head barely hangs on.
Blood, guts, guns, cuts.
Knives, lives, wives, nuns, sluts.
Chorus: Eminem
Bitch I'ma kill you! You don't wanna fuck with me.
Girls leave - you ain't nuttin but a slut to me
Bitch I'ma kill you! You ain't got the balls to beef.
We ain't gon' never stop beefin' I don't squash the beef.
You better kill me! I'ma be another rapper dead
for poppin' off at the mouth with shit I shouldn'ta said.
But when they kill me - I'm bringin' the world with me.
Bitches too! You ain't nuttin' but a girl to me.
..I said you don't, wanna fuck with Shady, ('cause why?)
'Cause Shady, will fuckin' kill you. (ah-haha)
I said you don't, wanna fuck with Shady, (why?)
Cuz Shady, will fuckin' kill you
[Eminem]
Bitch I'ma kill you! Like a murder weapon, I'ma conceal you
in a closet with mildew, sheets, pillows and film you
Buck with me, I been through hell, shut the hell up!
I'm tryin' to develop these pictures of the Devil to sell 'em
I ain't acid rap, but I rap on acid
Got a new blow-up probe and just had a strap-on added.
Whoops! Is that a subliminal hint? No!
Just criminal intent to sodomize women again
Eminem offend? No! Eminem on assault.
And if you ever give in to him, you give him an impulse
to do it again, Then, if he does it again
you'll probably end up jumpin' out of somethin' up in the 10th
(Ahhhhhhhh!) Bitch I'ma kill you, I ain't done, this ain't the chorus.
I ain't even drug you in the woods yet to paint the forest
A bloodstain is orange after you wash it three or four times
in the tub but that's normal ain't it Norman?
Serial killer hidin' murder material

Here we go again, we're out of our medicine,
out of our minds, and we want in yours, let us in.

Eh-heh, know why I say these things?
Cause ladies' screams keep creepin' in Shady's dreams.
And the way things seem, I shouldn't have to pay these shrinks
these eighty G's a week to say the same things Tweece!
Twice? Whatever, I hate these things
Fuck shots! I hope the weed'll outweigh these drinks
Motherfuckers want me to come on their radio shows
just to argue with 'em cuz their ratings stink?
Fuck That! I'll choke radio announcer to bouncer,
from fat bitch to all seventy-thousand pounds of her.
From principal, to the student body, and counselor,
from in-school, to before school, to out of school.
I don't even believe in breathin', I'm leavin' air in your lungs
just to hear you keep screamin' for me to seep it.
Okay, I'M Ready To Go Play
I Got The Machete From O.J.
I'M Ready To Make Everyone'S Throats Ache!

Taping bombs to the back of record companies
Blow them up if they ain't want me
The National Guard, they scared to hunt me
I love beef; I got you hoes duckin me
A drug thief, bitch I'll take your marijuana
These slugs with keep your ass away from my corner
I drown niggas in hundred degree saunas
You can act a fool if you wanna (bitch)
It's this lyrical piranha
Strapped with a grenade, in the pool with your mama
Attack her by the legs then I pull her to the bottom
Twist nothin up like a condom
Slap it if you fuckers got a problem
When I see them, you hoes ending up in a fuckin mausoleum

Pull in the garage while you screamin

My adolescent years weren't shit 'till what I do now
I never grew up I was born grown, and grew down
The older I get, the dumber the shit, I get in
The more ignorant, the incident, is I fit in
Ignoring the shit how boring it gets
When there's no one to hit
I don't know when to quit throwing a fit
I know I'm a bit flaky but they make me
Its they who raised me and say the can take me
Its they who legs I brake and make achy
Its they who mistake me and make me so angry
(I'll Shit On You!) I'll spit on you
Start pissing and do the opposite on you
You weren't listening, I said I'll cop a squat on you
Start spilling my guts like chicken cordon blew and

Spent all of my advancements on weed and guns

Jump out and beat your peeps down worst than Steve Stout
Put you in chokeholds I learned last week
From the Police man who caught me stealing weed from his jeep

Thats like D-Bo fightin Peablo Bryson (I'll Shit On You)

The baby came out - disfigured, ligaments indeed
It was a seed who would grow up just as crazy as she
Don't dare make fun of that baby cause that baby was me
I'm a Criminal - an animal caged who turned crazed
But how the fuck you sposed to grow up when you weren't raised?
So as I got older and I got a lot taller
My dick shrunk smaller, but my balls got larger
I drink malt liquor to fuck you up quicker
than you'd wanna fuck me up for sayin the word ...

Sex in his Oval Office on top of his desk
Off of his own employee

Motherfuckers -
say that I'm foolish I only talk about jewels (bling bling)
Do you fools listen to music or do you just skim
through it?
See I'm influenced by the ghetto you ruined
That same dude you gave nothin, I made somethin doin
what I do through and through and
I give you the news - with a twist it's just his
ghetto point-of-view
The renegade; you been afraid
I penetrate pop culture, bring 'em a lot closer to the
block where they
pop toasters, and they live with they moms
Got dropped roasters, from botched robberies niggaz
crotched over
Mommy's knocked up cause she wasn't watched over
Knocked down by some clown when child support knocked
No he's not around - now how that sound to ya, jot it
down
I bring it through the ghetto without ridin 'round
hidin down duckin strays from frustrated youths stuck
in they ways
Just read a magazine that fucked up my day
How you rate music that thugs with nothin relate to
it?
I help them see they way through it - not you
Can't step in my pants
Can't walk in my shoes
Bet everything you worth; you lose your tie and your
shirt

Since I'm in a position to talk to these kids and they
listen
I ain't no politician but I'll kick it with 'em a
minute
Cause see they call me a menace; and if the shoe fits
I'll wear it
But if it don't, then y'all'll swallow the truth grin
and bear it
Now who's these king of these rude ludicrous lucrative
lyrics
Who could inherit the title, put the youth in
hysterics
Usin his music to steer it, sharin his views and his
merits
But there's a huge interference - they're sayin you
shouldn't hear it
Maybe it's hatred I spew, maybe it's food for the
spirit
Maybe it's beautiful music I made for you to just
cherish
But I'm debated disputed hated and viewed in America
as a motherfuckin drug addict - like you didn't
experiment?
Now now, that's when you start to stare at who's in
the mirror
and see yourself as a kid again, and you get
embarrased
And I got nothin to do but make you look stupid as
parents
You fuckin do-gooders - too bad you couldn't do good
at marriage!
(Ha ha!) And do you have any clue what I had to do to
get here I don't
think you do so stay tuned and keep your ears glued to

Whatchu hollerin? Gotta pay rent, bring dollars in
By the bodega, iron under my coat, feelin braver
Doo-rag wrappin my waves up,
Pockets full of hope
Do not step to me - I'm awkward,
I box leftier often
My pops left me an orphan,
My momma wasn't home
Could not stress to me I wasn't grown;
'Specially on nights
I brought somethin home to quiet the stomach rumblings
My demeanor - thirty years my senior
My childhood didn't mean much, only raisin green up
Raisin my fingers to critics;
Raisin my head to the sky
Big I did it - multi before I die (nigga)
No lie, just know I chose my own fate
I drove by the fork in the road and went straight

But that ain't the case, see it's a matter of taste
We as a people decide if Shady's as bad as they say he
is
Or is he the latter - a gateway to escape?
Media scapegoat, who they can be mad at today
See it's easy as cake, simple as whistlin Dixie
while I'm wavin the pistol at sixty Christians against

Go to war with the Mormons, take a bath with the

in holy water - no wonder they try to
Hold me under longer

My name is Marshall Mathers, I'm an alcoholic (Hi Marshall)
I have a disease and they don't know what to call it
Better hide your wallet cause I'm comin up quick to strip your cash
Bought a ticket to your concert just to come and whip your ass
Bitch, I'm comin out swingin, so fast it'll make your eyes spin
You gettin knocked the fuck out like Mike Tyson
The Proof is in the puddin, just ask the Deshaun Holton
I'll slit your motherfuckin throat worse than Ron Goldman
Chorus:
So when you see me on your block with two glocks
Screamin ""Fuck the World"" like Tupac
I just don't give a fuck!!
Talkin that shit behind my back, dirty mackin
tellin your boys that I'm on crack
I just don't give a fuck!!
So put my tape back on the rack
Go run and tell your friends my shit is wack
I just don't give a fuck!!
But see me on the street and duck
Cause you gon' get stuck, stoned, and snuffed
Cause I just don't give a fuck!!
I'm Nicer than Pete, but I'm on a Serch to crush a Milkbone
I'm Everlasting, I melt Vanilla Ice like silicone
I'm ill enough to just straight up diss you for no reason
I'm colder than snow season when it's twenty below freezin
Flavor with no seasonin, this is the sneak preview
I'll diss your magazine and still won't get a weak review
I'll make your freak leave you, smell the Folgers crystals
This is a lyrical combat, gentlemen hold your pistols
But I form like Voltron and blast you with my shoulder missiles
Slim Shady, Eminem was the old initials (Bye-bye!)
Extortion, snortin, supportin abortion
Pathological liar, blowin shit outta proportion
The looniest, zaniest, spontaneous, sporadic
Impulsive thinker, compulsive drinker, addict
Half animal, half man
Dumpin your dead body inside of a fuckin trash can
With more holes than an Afghan
(Chorus)
Somebody let me out this limousine (hey, let me out!)
I'm a caged demon, on stage screamin like Rage Against the Machine
I'm convinced I'm a fiend, shootin up while this record is spinnin
Clinically brain dead, I don't need a second opinion.
Fuck droppin the jewel, I'm flippin the sacred treasure
I'll bite your motherfuckin style, just to make it fresher
I can't take the pressure, I'm sick of bitches
Sick of naggin bosses bitchin while I'm washin dishes
In school I never said much, too busy havin a headrush
Doin too much rush had my face flushed like red blush
Then I went to Jim Beam, that's when my face grayed
Went to gym in eighth grade, raped the women's swim team
Don't take me for a joke I'm no comedian
Too many mental problems got me snortin coke and smokin weed again
I'm goin up over the curb, drivin on the median
Finally made it home, but I don't got the key to get in
(Chorus)
(Outro)
Hey, fuck that!

Curtains Up,Encore,2004,"Applause

Encore version:
Still on?
Yo, is the mic on?
Check, check, check
Alright, let's do it
Let's go, come on
(Eminem, Eminem, Eminem)"
Yellow Brick Road,Encore,2004,"What we have to do is deal with it when these individuals are young enough
If you wish to be saved, not in a religious sense
but not to constitute what this country at times calls if or which over
We seem to be approaching an age of the gross
We all have this idea that we should move up from our parents station
and each generation should do a little bit better
Aight come on, let's cut the bullshit enough
Let's get it started, let's start addressing this issue and open it up
Let's take this shit back to ""Bassmint""
And we can discuss statements that's made on this tape
And it's whole origin of the music that we all know and love
The music that we all enjoy the music you all accuse me of tryna destroy
Let's rewind it to 89 when I was a boy on the east side of Detroit
Crossin' 8 Mile in the border in the hate territory
I'd like to share a story
this is my story and can't no body tell it for me
You will well inform me
I am well aware that I don't belong here
You've made that perfectly clear
I get my ass kicked damn near everywhere
From Bel-Air shopping center just for stopping in there
From the black side all the way to the white side
Okay there's a bright side, a day that I might slide
You may call it a past, I call it haulin' my ass
Through that patch of grass over them railroad tracks
Oh them railroad tracks, them old railroad tracks
Them good old notorious oh well known tracks
CHORUS
So let's go back
Follow the yellow brick road as we go on another episode
Journey with me as I take you through this nifty little place
that I once used to call home sweet home
Come on let's go back
Follow the yellow brick road as we go on another episode
Journey with me as I take you through this nifty little place
that I once used to call home sweet home
I roam the streets so much they call me a drifter
Sometimes I stick up a thumb just to hitch hike
Just to get picked up to get me a lift to 8 Mile and van dike
And steal a Goddamn bike from somebody's backyard
And drop it off at the park that was the half way mark
To meet Kim had to walk back to her mama's them dramas after dark
To sneak me in the house when I'm kicked out my mom's
That's about the time I first met Proof, when poof he'd carry on the set
Set eyes born in and out some flyers, he was doin' some talent shows
At centerline, I had told him to stop by and check this out sometime
He looked at me like I'm out my mind
Shook his head like white boys don't know how to rhyme
I spit out a line, rhymed ""birthday"" with ""first place""
And we both had the same rhymes that sound alike
We was on the same shit that Big Daddy Kane shit
wit' compound syllables sound combined
From that day we was down to ride
somehow we knew we'd meet again somewhere down the line
Chorus
My first year in 9th grade, can't forget that day at school
It was cool till your man MC Sham came through
And said that Boom was the brain 'cause the clan makes troops
It was rumors but man god damned they flew
Musta been true because man we done banned they shoes
I had the new ones the Cool J, Ice land swayed too
And we just through them in the trash like they yesterday's news
Guess who came through next, X clam debut
Professor X (and glorious)
exists in a state of red, black, and green with a key, sissies
Now with this bein' a new trend, we don't fit in
Crackers is out with Cactus albums, blackness is in
African symbols and medallions
represent black power, and we ain't know what it meant
Me and my man Howard and ??? would go to the mall
wit' 'em all over our necks like we're showin' 'em off
Not knowin' at all we was bein' laughed at
You ain't even half black
You ain't 'posed to have that
Homie let me grab that
And that Flavor Flave clock
We gon' have to snatch that
All I remember is meetin' back at, Manix's basement
Sayin' how we hate this, our races wit' dope the x clan take this
Which reminds me, back in '89 me, and Kim broke up for the first time
She was tryna two time me
And there was this black girl at our school
who thought I was cool 'cause I rapped, so she was kinda eyein' me
And oh the irony, guess what her name was?
I ain't even gon' say it plus
The same color hair as hers was and blue contacts and a pair of jugs
The bombast God damn girl in our whole school
If I could pull it not only would I become more popular
but I would be able to piss Kim off at the same time
But it backfired, I was supposed to dump her
but she dumped me for this black guy
And that's the last I ever seen or heard or spoke to the oh foolish pride girl
But I've heard people say they heard the tape and it ain't that bad
But it was I singled out a whole race and for that apologize
I was wrong, 'cause no matter what color a girl is she still a ???
Chorus"
Never Enough ,Encore,2004,"[Eminem]
There's not much you could do or say to phase me
People think I'm a little bit crazy
I get it from all angles, even occasionally Doc Dre-zie'll
Have to step in every once in a while to save me
To make me stop and think about it 'fore I just say things
Sometimes I forget what other people just may think
A lot of rappers finally wouldn't know how to take me
If they heard some shit, I'd lay the tape 'fore they erase me
I maybe a little too fast paced and racy
Sometimes the average listener rewinds and plays me twenty times
'cause I say so many rhymes, it may seem
like I'm goin' too fast 'cause my mind is racing
And I could give a fuck what category you place me
Long as when I'm pushing up daisies and gone
As long as you place me amongst one of them greats
When I hit the heavenly gates I'll be cool beside Jay-Z
For every single die hard fan who embraced me
I'm thankful for the talent in which God gave me
And I'm thankful for the environment that he placed me
Believe it or not, I thank my mom for how she raised me
In the neighborhood daily, they jumped and chased me
It only made me what I am today, see
Regardless of what anybody believes who hates me
You ain't gonna make or break me
Tryna strip me of my credibility and make me look fake, G
You're only gonna be in for a rude awakening
'Cause sooner or later you haters are all gonna face me
And when you face me with all the shit you've been saving to say to me
You had all this time to think about it
Now don't pussy out and try to wimp out, face me
'Cause I've been patiently waiting for the day
That we finally meet in the same place to see
Chorus [Nate Dogg]
No matter how many battles I've been in and won
No matter how many magazines on my nuts
No matter how many Mc's I've end up
Ohh, it's never enough
No matter how many battles I've been in and won
No matter how many magazines on my nuts
No matter how many Mc's I eat up
Ohh, ohh, it's never enough
[50 Cent]
My flow's untouchable now you gotta face it (Uh oh)
It gets worse when I go back to the basics
You go, say the wrong shit and get your face split
The smell of victory, love it so much I can taste it
The spot my talk, it blaze a direct hit
Graze it, your peace talk, save it
Your shit sounds dated, you're overrated
I'm obligated to study your moves then crush you mutherfuckers
If I'm the best and the worst, then God's gift is a curse
Soldier trained to destroy, you payin' attention boy?
I spit shit, slick shit, so quick you miss it
To be specific I go ballistic as hieroglyphic
My music is a drug, press play, you ain't gotta sniff it
Chew it or pop it, roll a bag of the chocolate
Get your high over and over, but you gotta cop it
When it's hot, it's hot
Your hatin' is undeniable, stop it
Chorus"
Evil Deeds,Encore,2004,"Lord please forgive me for what I do
For I know not what I've done
CHORUS
Father please forgive me for I know not what I do
I just never had the chance to ever meet you
Therefore I did not know that I would grow to be
my mother's evil seed and do these evil deeds
Momma had a baby and it's head popped off
(head popped off, head popped off, head popped off, head popped off, head popped off)
My momma don't want me, the next thing I know I'm gettin' dropped off
(gettin' dropped off, gettin' dropped off, gettin' dropped off, gettin' dropped off)
Ring ring ring, on the doorbell and the next door neighbors on their front porch
(their front porch, their front porch, their front porch, their front porch)
But they didn't want me neither so they left me on someone else's lawn
(else's lawn, else's lawn, else's lawn)
Till somebody finally took me in, my great aunt and uncle Edna and Charles
(Edna and Charles, Edna and Charles, Edna and Charles, Edna and Charles)
They were the ones who were left in charge
My elementary they gang up on me and sang this song
(sang this song, sang this song, sang this song, sang this song)
It go a little something like
""Mary had a little lamb, little lamb, little lamb
Debbie had a Satan spawn, Satan spawn
Momma why do they keep saying this I just don't understand, understand
And by the way, where's my dad?""
Chorus
Predominantly, predominantly, everything's always predominantly
Predominantly white, predominantly black
But what about me, where does that leave me
Well I guess that I'm between predominantly both of 'em
I think if I hear that fuckin' word again I'ma scream
While I'm projectile vomiting, what do I look like, a comedian to you?
Do you think that I'm kidding?
What do I look like some kind of idi...
Wait a minute, shit, don't answer that
Why am I so misunderstood?
Why do I go through so much bullshit, it sucks bullshit, it's just mo' bitch
Woe is me, there goes poor Marshall again
Whining about his millions and his mansion and his sorrow he's always drownin' in
From the dad he never had, and how his childhood was so bad
And how his mom was a dope addict, and his ex-wife how they go at it
Man I'd hate to have it, as bad as that Mr. Mathers claims he had it
I can't imagine it, that little rich poor white bastard
needs to take some of that cash out the bank and take a bath in it
Man if I only had half of it... (shit)
If you only knew the half of it
Chorus
Evil deeds, while I plant these evil seeds
Please release me from these demons
I never had any of this shit planned ma, please believe
I don't wanna be Satan's spawn, never got the chance to say I'm sorry
Now look at all the pain I caused
Dear Santa Clause, why you not comin' this year again
What did I do that was so bad to deserve this
Everything could have been so perfect
But life ain't a fairytale, I'm about to be hoist up in the air
Forty feet below me, there's people everywhere
I don't even know what it feel like, they know me 'cause I'm in this ferris wheel
And all I wanna do is go to the mall and take Hailie on the carousel
Without this crowd everywhere I go
but life is like a merry-go-round
Here we go now, doe see doe, now curtains up, the show must go
Now ring around the rosie, the shows over, you can all go home now
But the curtain just don't close for me
This ain't how fame is supposed to be
Where's the switch I could just turn off and on, this ain't what I chose to be
So please God, give me the strength to have what it takes to carry on
Till I pass 50 back the baton, the camera's on, myself is gone
Father please forgive me for I know not what I do
I just never had the chance to ever meet you
Therefore I did not know that I would grow to be
my mother's evil seed and do these evil deeds
I said father please forgive me for I know not what I do
I just never had the chance to ever meet you
Therefore I did not know that I would grow to be
my mother's evil seed and do these evil deeds
Oh!
Last one baby
Let's go
DETROIT!"
Puke,Encore,2004,"[Sounds of someone puking]
There I go--thinking of you again
[Chorus]
You don't know how sick you make me
You make me fuckin' sick to my stomach
Every time I think of you, I puke
You must just not know-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-ho
You may not think you do, but you do
Every time I think of you, I puke. (1st verse)
I was gonna take the time to sit down and write you a little poem
But off of the dome would probably be a little more, more suitable, for this type of song, whoa
I got a million reasons off the top of my head that I can think a
Sixteen bars this ain't enough to put some ink ta
So fuck it I'ma start right here I'll just be brief I'm
Bout to rattle off some other reasons.
I knew I shouldn't go and get another tattoo, of you
On my arm but what do I go and do ?
I go and get another one, now I got two. hooooo. Now
I'm sittin' here with your name on my skin
I can't believe I went and did this stupid shit again
My next girlfriend now her names gotta be Kim
Shiiiiiit!
If you only knew, how much I hated you
For every mother fuckin thing you've ever put us through
Then I wouldn't be standing here crying over you
Booooo-Hoooo.
[Chorus]
You don't know how sick you make me
You make me fuckin' sick to my stomach
Every time I think of you I puke
You must just not know--oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-ho
You may not think you do, but you do
Every time I think of you, I puke (2nd verse)
I was gonna take the time to sit down and write you a little letter
But I thought a song would probably be a little better
Instead of a letter
That you'd probably just shread up. Yeah.
I stumbled on your picture yesterday and it made me stop and think a
How much of a waste it'd be for me to put some ink ta
a stupid piece a,paper.
I'd rather let you see how
Much I fuckin' hate you in a freestyle
You're a fuckin' cokehead slut, I hope you fuckin' die
I hope you get to hell and Satan sticks a needle in your eye
I hate your fuckin' guts, you fuckin' slut I hope you die
Diiieeee.
But please don't get me wrong, I'm not bitter or mad
It's not that I still love you it's not 'cause I want you back
It's just that when I think of you, it makes me wanna yack.Aaaaaaaak.
But what else can I do? I haven't got a clue
Now I guess I'll just move on, I have no choice but to
But every time I think of you now all I wanna do
Is puuukke!
[Chorus]
You don't know how sick you make me
You make me fuckin' sick to my stomach
Every time I think of you I puke
You must just not know-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-ho
You may not think you do
but you do every time I think of you, I puke"
Mosh,Encore,2004,"""I pledge allegiance to the flag
Of the United States of America
And to the Republic for which it stands
One nation under God
Indivisible...""
It feels so good to be back...
Mosh with me now...
You scrutinize every word
Memorize every line
I spit it once, refuel
Re-energize and rewind
I give sight to the blind
My insight through the mind
I exercise my right
To express when I feel it's time
It's just all in your mind
What you interpret it as
I say to fight, you take it
As I'mma whip someone's ass
If you don't understand
Don't even bother to ask
A father who has
Grown up with a fatherless past
Who has blown up now
To rap phenomenon that has
Or at least shows no difficulty multi-task
And in juggling both
Perhaps mastered his craft
Slash entrepreneur
Who has held onto few more rap acts
Who's had a few obstacles
Thrown his way through the last half
Of his career typical
Manure moving past that
Mr. kisses ass crack
He's a class act
Rubber band man
Yea, he just snaps back
Come along, follow me
As I lead through the darkness
As I provide just enough spark
That we need to proceed
Carry on, give me hope
Give me strength
Come with me
And I won't steer you wrong
Put your faith and your trust
As I guide us through the fog
To the light at the end of the tunnel
We gon' fight, we gon' charge
we gon' stomp, we gon' march
Through the swamp
We gon' mosh through the marsh
Take us right through the doors
C'mon
All the people up top
On the side and the middle
Come together, let's all bomb
And swamp just a little
Just let it gradually build
From the front to the back
All you can see is a sea of people
Some white and some black
Don't matter what color
All that matters: we gathered together
To celebrate for the same cause
Don't matter the weather
If it rains, let it rain
Yea, the wetter, the better
They ain't gonna stop us, they can't
We stronger now more than ever
They tell us ""no"" we say ""yea""
They tell us ""stop"" we say ""go""
Rebel with a rebel yell
Raise hell we gonna let'em know
Stomp, push, shove, mush
Fuck Bush!
Until they bring our troops home
C'mon
Just come along, follow me
As I lead through the darkness
As I provide just enough spark
That we need to proceed
Carry on, give me hope
Give me strength
Come with me
And I won't steer you wrong
Put your faith and your trust
As I guide us through the fog
To the light at the end of the tunnel
We gonna fight, we gonna charge
we gonna stomp, we gonna march
Through the swamp
We gonna mosh through the marsh
Take us right through the doors
C'mon
Imagine it pouring
It's raining down on us
Mosh pits outside the oval office
Someone's tryina tell us something
Maybe this is God
Just sayin' we're responsible
For this monster, this coward
That we have empowered
This is Bin Laden
Look at his head noddin'
How could we allow something like this
without pumping our fists?
Now this is our final hour
Let me be the voice
In your strength and your choice
Let me simplify the rhyme
Just to amplify the noise
Try to amplify the times it
And multiply by six...
Teen million people
Are equal at this high pitch
Maybe we can reach
Al Qaeda through my speech
Let the president answer
A higher anarchy
Strap him with an Ak-47
Let him go fight his own war
Let him impress Daddy that way
No more blood for oil
we got our own battles
To fight on our own soil
No more psychological warfare
To trick us to thinking that we ain't loyal
If we don't serve our own country
We're patronizing a hero
Look in his eyes, it's all lies
The stars and stripes
They've been swiped
Washed out and wiped
And replaced with his own face
Mosh now or die
If I get sniped tonight
You know why,
'Cause I told you to fight
Come along, follow me
As I lead through the darkness
As I provide just enough spark
That we need to proceed
Carry on, give me hope
Give me strength
Come with me
And I won't steer you wrong
Put your faith and your trust
As I guide us through the fog
To the light at the end of the tunnel
We gonna fight, we gonna charge
we gonna stomp, we gonna march
Through the swamp
We gonna mosh through the marsh
Take us right through the doors
C'mon
And as we proceed
To Mosh through this desert storm
In these closing statements
If they should argue
Let us beg to differ
As we set aside our differences
And assemble our own army
To disarm this Weapon of Mass Destruction
That we call our president
For the present
And Mosh for the future of our next generation
To speak and be heard
Mr. President, Mr. Senator
Do you guy's hear us?
Hear us?"
My 1st Single,Encore,2004,"Ohhhhhh!

'Cause he was as big as ???
He used to be Superman
Now we're pourin' liquor on the crib in his name for him

Ready get set, let's go
Here comes the ?? stompin' and stampedin' up the damn street
Like them buffalo soldiers, I told ya I'm bout' to blow
So look out below, Geronimo, motherfuckers is dominos
I'm on a roll, around and around I go
When will I stop? I don't know
Tryna pick up where the ""Eminem Show"" left off
But I know anything's possible
Though I'm not gonna top what I sold
I'm at the top of my game
That shit is not gonna change
Long as I got Dr. Dre on my team
I'll get away with murder
I'm Michael J., he's like my cock from the day
We keep the mark from the tapes in a safe, locked them away
Better watch what you say
Just when you thought you were safe
Them fuckers got you on tape
You swear to God you was playin'
Whether or not you was little Joshua
Gosh I wish I coulda told you to not do the same
'Cause one day it could cost you your name

And woke up in bed next to his best friend Derrick bare naked
Chicka chicka chicka chicka chicka
And then just turned sixteen and used a fake ID
to sneak in V.I.P. to see R. Kelly (hihihihihi)
To be so young and naive
Oh what I wouldn't give to live so Kim and care free
Paris and Nikki's parents must be so tickled to cherish
every picture with their kids with hickeys all over their necks
Hickory Dickory derr digga
Look at me work wizardry with these words
Am I a jerk or just jerk chicken
Or chicka chicka chicka chicka jer jer jerkin the chain
Twenty-two jerks and a jerk circle
Or is it a circle jerk or wait a minute
What am I sayin', allow me to run it back and rewind it rrrrrrara
Let me ask you again
Am I just jerkin' the chain
Am I bizerk or insane
Or am I just one of them damn amateurs
workin' the damn camera filmin' one of them
Paris Hilton home made porno's
Who keeps tiltin' the lens at an angle
Chicka chicka
Just recently somebody just discovered
Britney and Justin videotapes of 'em fuckin'
When they were just musketeers in the Mickey Mouse club
And dusted them and went straight to The Source with them
'cause they coulda sworn someone said nuh...
And then tried to erase and record over it
But, if you listen close enough to it you can hear the
Uh ah, and then the come ta, find out it was Jus-tin
Sayin 'I'm done-uh!'
Come on this was su-pposed...
To be my first single
But I just fucked that up so

All you gotta do is pick up the phone and just dial up this number
It's 1-800-I'm-a-dick-sucker-I-love-to-suck-a-dick
And if someone picks up you can talk all the shit you want about me
Just type in your number back and follow it by the pound key
And I'll be sure to get back
As soon as there comes a day that I fall out with Dre
Wake up gay, make up with Ray (Hey!)
So fuck a chicken, lick a chicken, suck a chicken
Beat a chicken, eat a chicken like it's a big cock, bawka-bi-kaw
Or suck a dick, and lick a dick and eat a dick and stick a dick in your mouth
I'm done you can fuck off, fucka-fuck off!

Paul,Encore,2004,"Hey, what's going on, this is Paul Rosenberger, attorney of
law. Listen, I listened to the rough copy of your album And
uh, you know I've just got to be honest with you Can you tone
it down a little bit? Because there's only so much I can
explain. Give me a call."
Rain Man,Encore,2004,"Yeah
Definitely, definitely
Definitely dawg
Definitely, definitely K-Mart
Yeah, yeah
You find me offensive? I find you offensive
for finding me offensive
Hence if I should draw a line on any fences
If so to what extense if
Any, should I go?
'Cause it's getting expensive
Being on the other side of the courtroom on the defensive
They say I cause extensive psychological nerve damage
to the brain when I go to lengths this
Far at other people's expenses
I say you're all just too God damn sensitive, it's censorship
And it's down right blasphemous
Listen to shit now 'cause I won't stand for this
And Chirs-stiff-pher Reeves won't sit for this neither
And let's clear this up too I ain't got no beef with him either
He used to be like a hero to me
I even believe I, had one of those 25 cent stickers on my re-frigerator
Right next to Darth Vader
And Darth musta put a hex on him for later
I feel like it's my fault 'cause of the way that
I stuck him up in between him and Lex Luther
I killed Superman, I killed Super-man
And how ironic, that I'd be the bad guy
Kryptonite, the green chronic
CHORUS
'Cause I ain't got no legs, or no brain
Nice to meet you
Hi, my name is...
I forgot my name!
My name was not to become
what I became with this level of fame
My soul is possessed by this devil
My new name is.... Rain Man
Now in the Bible it says
Thou shall not watch two lesbians in bed
Have homosexual sex
Unless of course you were given the consent to join in
Then of course, it's intercourse
And it's bi-sexual sex
Which isn't as bad, as long as you show some remorse for your actions
Either before, during or after performing the act of that which
Is normally referred to have such, more commonly known phrases
That are more used by today's kids
In a more derogatory way but
Who's to say, what's fair to say, and what not to say?
Let's ask Dr. Dre
Dr. Dre? (What up?)
I gotta question if I may? (Yeah)
Is it gay, to play Putt-Putt golf with a friend (Yeah)
And watch his butt-butt when he tees off? (Yeah)
But, but I ain't done yet
In football the quarterback yells out hutt-hutt
While he reaches in another grown man's ass
Grabs on his nuts but just what if
It was never meant it was just an accident
But he tripped, fell, slipped and his penis went in
His teeny tiny little round hiney and he didn't mean it
But his little weenie flinched just a little bit
And I don't mean to go in into anymore details but
What if he pictured it as a females butt?
Is that gay? I just need to clear things up
Till then I'll just walk around with a manly strut because...
Chorus
You find me offensive? I find you offensive
Shit, this is the same verse I just did this
When am I gonna come to my good senses?
Probably the day Bush comes to my defenses
My spider senses telling me Spiderman is nearby
And my plan is to get him next
And open up a whip ass canister
God damn it Dre where is the God damn beat? (Yeah)
Anyway, anyway I don't know how else to put it
This is the only thing that I'm good at
I am the bad guy, kryptonite, the green chronic
Demonic, yep yep, don't worry I'm on it
I got it, high five Nick Lachey
Stuck a pen in Jessica's head and walked away
And she blew around the room like a balloon-a
Grabbed the last can of chicken tuna out the trash can and screw my
Head is straight back to the Neverland Ranch
With a peanut butter, jelly, chicken, tuna sandwich
And I don't gotta make no God damn sense
I just did a whole song and I didn't say shit
Chorus
'Cause Iahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh
Yo, Rain Man
Definitely, definitely Dr. Dre
Super dope, beat maker, two thousand and
Two thousand four hundred and eighty seven million
Nine hundred and sev' seventy three thousand four hundred and sixty three
And seventy (Yeah)

Big Weenie,Encore,2004,"I don't understand
Why you're being so mean
You're a mean, mean man
CHORUS
You are just jealous of me
'cause you, you just can't do what I do
So instead of just admitting it
You walk around and say
all kinds of really mean things
about me 'cause you're a meanie, a meanie
But it's only 'cause you're just really jealous of me
'cause I'm what you wanna be
So you just look like an idiot
When you say these mean things
'cause it's too easy to see
You're really just a big weenie, big weenie
Alright listen, I need you to focus
I need you to go dig deep in your mind, this is
important
We are going to perform an experiment of a sort
I'm going to have to ask you to bare with me for a
moment
Now I need you to open your mind, your eyes close 'em
You are now about to be placed under my hypnosis
For the next 4 and a half minutes
we are going to explore into your mind to find out why
you're so fuckin' jealous
Now why do they make you who
Pibbity-cock-a-poo-poo
Psych, I'm kidding I just wanted to see if you're
still listening
Okay now I need your un-divided attention
Sir I have a question
Why do I always sense this, undeniable tension?
From the moment that I enter into the room it gets all
quiet and whispers
Whenever there's conversations
why am I always mentioned?
I been dying to ask, it's been itching at me
Is it just because...
Chorus
Alright now I, I just flubbed a line
I was going to say something extremely important
but I forgot who or were what it was, I fucked up
Psych, I'm kidding again you idiot, no I didn't
That's just what you wanted to hear from me
is that I fucked up ain't it?
But I can bust one take without lookin' at no paper
It doesn't take a bunch of takes
or me to stand here in this booth all day for me to
say the truth, ok?
You're droolin', you have tooth decay
Your mouth is open, you're disgusting
What the fuck you eat for lunch
A bunch of sweets or something, what?
You munch a bunch of Crunch 'N Munch?
Your tooth is rotten to the gum
Your breath stinks, wanna chew some gum?
Yes I do sir, what am I on?
You sir are on chew serum
Marshall I'm so jealous of you
Please say you won't tell nobody
I'd be so embarrassed, I'm just absolutely terrified
That someone's gonna find out why I'm saying
All these terrible, evil and awful mean things
It's my own insecurity!
Chorus
Alright now we, we're going to conduct
That experiment that we were talking about earlier
Just to see what a frog, looks like when it takes two
hits of ecstasy
'cause that's exactly what your eyes look like, want
to check to see?
Here's a mirror, notice the resemblance here?
Wait, let me put these sunglasses on
Now look in this mirror, how about now?
What do you have in common?
You're both green with envy and look like idiots with
sunglasses on 'em
You look like I sound like singing about weenies
Now take my weenie out of your mouth
This is between me and you, I know you're not happy
I know you'd much rather see me lying in the corner of
a room somewhere crying
Curled up in a ball tweaked out of my mind dying
There is no denying that my weenie is much bigger than
yours is
Mine is like sticking a banana between two oranges
Why you even doing this to yourself, it's pointless
Why do we have to keep on going through this, this is
tortuous
My point is this
That if you say mean things, weenie will shrink
Now I forgot what the chorus is,
your just is...
Chorus"
Em Calls Paul (skit) (1),Encore,2004,"Aye yo Paul, It's Em
I got your call about the Michael Jackson thing
And I know that he's not 'thrilled' about the video
What does he 'wanna be startin' somethin'?'
Well I'll show him who's really 'bad'
Paul, 'the way you make me feel' with these calls
You should really take a look at the 'man in the mirror'
And tell him to 'beat it' because I 'won't stop till I get enough'
Do you 'remember the time' we were watching the 'Billy Jean' video?
Well he'll always be that Michael to me
And it doesn't matter if he's 'black or white'
Because I 'can't stop loving him' and I hate plastic surgeons
And I hope they all fucking die!
How do you like that?
And I like him, I like him a lot
I want to touch him but I can't
Excuse me, I'm taking a shit
Sorry
Anyways, call me back
I have this idea about how I want to end the show
So, hit me when you get this message fucker
Oh, and by the way
No I don't have a new gun *click* (goddamn it)"

Spend Some Time ,Encore,2004,"[Eminem]
If there's any bitches in this room
then there's something I gotta say
For all the fools who fell for the first girl who comes their way
I've been down that road and now I'm back, sittin' on square one
Tryin' to pick myself up where I started from
[Obie Trice]
I never woulda thought that I'd see you outta control
Even though my penis was deep down in your hole
You should know between us we was like mates to soul
Nothing could intervene us, especially no ho's
You was more or so the chalant type, I chose
To more shows, haunted you nights I suppose
That's how it go, with time spent, emotion grows
In the beginning, friends we decided to roll
So who's responsible when you get excited, explode
And Obie's grinnin', then you invite that Obie's cold
But bitches the gon' talk, niggas they gon' hate
We established this way before we became mates
So what's required is that you chill with all that fire
Get your desire when I retire
Chorus
Spend some time with me, say that you'll be mine
I never thought I'd find someone to be mine
Lord knows I was right, 'cause you just crossed the line
Spend some time with me, say that you'll be mine
[Eminem]
I used to say I never met a girl like you before
Still ain't got a fuckin' clue as to who you truly are
Almost went as far as introducing you to my daughters
Till you went as far as goin' and snoopin' through my drawers
Now I just feel stupid for the loop that you threw me for
Can't believe I almost flew the coop for some stupid whore
You used to say all you wanted was for me to be yours
All I ever wanted from you was a few booty calls
If you recall I used to treat you as a groupie broad
When we fucked I refused to even take my jewelry off
But it threw me off the first time I called and you blew me off
It was a shock, it struck me as odd but it turned me on
You started getting moody on me, pretty soon we'd argue
And the ruder you got, the more beautiful you got to me
And who woulda even knew that who woulda even thought possibly
Cupid could shoot another one of them God damn darts at me
It's true that I got shot in the heart
But when someone seems too good to be true, they usually are
But see, when you're in it it's too hard to see
Till you pull up and see some other dude's car parked and reach
Up under the seat as your heart starts to beat
Before you make a decision that's life altering
And just as you halt and you turn and you start to leave
You hear them words echoing, almost haunting, that taunting ring
Chorus
[Stat Quo]
In most cases, Stat's attitude is fuck a bitch
My only motive is to get head and fuck a bitch
But you was different, thought we shared a covenant
Even held your hand in public, we sufferin' because of this
Shorty on some whole 'notha other shit
Tryna play sick thinkin' I'ma trick off rick
I'll admit, I was caught in the mix, down to commit
Feed you the best of me, I shoulda fed you piss
We started off closer than close
But who coulda predicted to know
Your triflin' ways woulda stopped our growth
And the final result, back in that same boat
I ask myself, do I love these hoes? No!
[50 Cent]
Em introduced us, ""50 this is Tanya, Tanya this is 50""
Then slid off and left her to kick it with me
I complimented her, I said you have very nice lips
With my imagination, I could see her suckin' my dick
We played the phone game, a week later, shit changed fast
Had her comin' over in a cab to give me some ass
Downtown Manhattan on the balcony, stare at the skyline
Penthouse full of imported shit, you know how I grind
She got to talkin', talkin' like an opportunist too
Why talk when suckin' my dick is the real career move?
Said she's an inspiring actress, she do videos for practice
Yeah, yeah, know how many times I done heard that shit?
Chorus"
Crazy In Love,Encore,2004,"You always thought that I was doing alright
But nothing that was through a night
But I'm crazy over you
Crazy on you
Let me go crazy crazy on youuuuuuuuu
Can't you see what you do to me baby?
You make me crazy, you make me act like a maniac.
I'm like a lunatic, you make me sick
You truly are the only one who can do this to me
You just make me get so crazy.
I go skitzo, I get so insane I just go skitzophrenic
One minute I want to slit your throat
The next I want sex.
You make me crazy,
The way we act like 2 maniacs in the sac
We fuck like 2 jackrabbits
And maybe that's a bad habit.
Cuz the next day we're right back at it
In the same exact pattern
What the fuck is the matter with us
We can't figure out if it's
Lust or it's love
What's sad is what's attracting us to each other
They say that every man grows up
To marry his own mother.
Which would explain why you're such a motherfucking bitch
But I stay and still stick it out with you
Even though I just hit you today
But you deserve it you hit me first and provoked me to choke you
Just cuz I came home late last night
Crawled in bed and I woke you.
But if there's one thing about you I admire its, baby,
Because you stay with me,
Maybe, because you're as crazy as I am
Cuz when I look at you
I can see an angel in your eyes
But if I look deeper inside
I see your freakish little side.
Like a devil in disguise,
You're always full of surprises
Always pullin' devises
Out your personal vibrators and dildos
You fucked yourself so much
You barely feel those anymore
You're only 24 but you're plenty more now.
Sure than those other little hoes
Who just act like little girls
Like they're in middle school still
You're crazy sexy cool, chillin
You play your position
You never step out of line
Even though I stay in your business
You've always kept out of mine.
I wonder whats on your mind
Sometimes they say love is blind
Maybe that's why the first time I dotted your eye
You ain't see a sign.
Or maybe you did
Maybe you like me and stuff
Maybe cuz we're crazy in loooove
Crazy on you
Crazy on you
Let me go crazy crazy on youuuuuuuuu
You're the ink to my paper
Where my pen is to my pad
The moral, the very fiber
The whole substance to my rap.
You are my reason for being
The meaning of my existence
If it wasn't for you
I would never be able to spit this
These sentences I do wit me I am me
Is you rely on me as much
As I rely on you to inspire me like you do.
You provide me the lighterfluid to fuel my fire
You're my entire supply gas, the match, the igniter.
The only way that I am able to stay so stable
Is you're the legs to my table
If you were to break I'd fall on my face.
But I'm always going to make you feel
I don't need you as much as I really need you
So you don't use it to your advantage.
But you're essential to me
You're the air I breathe
I believe if you ever leave me
I'd probably have no reason to be.
You are the kim to my marshall
You're the slim to my shady
The dre to my eminem
The elaina to my hailey.
You are the word I am looking for when
I'm trying to describe how I feel inside
And the right one just won't come to my mind.
You're like the pillar that props me up
The beam that supports me
The bitch who never took half,
The wife who never divorced me.
You're like the root to my evil
You let my devil come out me
You let me beat the shit out you
Before you beat the shit out me.
And no matter how much
Too much is never enough
Maybe cuz we're crazy in loooove
I'm crazy on you
Crazy over you
Let me go crazy crazy over youuuuuuuuu

One Shot 2 Shot ,Encore,2004,"{*gun shots, crowd screaming*}
I told y'all motherfuckers I was comin back (oh shit)
What now nigga, what now? What? Brewster Projects nigga
[Chorus: Eminem]
One shot, two shot, three shots, four shots
All I hear is gunshots, this is where the fun stops
Bodies drop, hit the floor, music's off, party stops
Everybody hit the door, somebody's lickin shots off
[Bizarre]
Security's gone, I'm trapped in the club
And I'm tryin to run and get my motherfuckin gun
(Nigga what about yo' wife?) Nigga fuck my wife
I'm tryin to run and save my motherfuckin life
Oh, shit! The shooter's comin
Bitches hollerin, niggaz runnin
People, shot all over the floor
And I'm tryin to make it to the St. Andrew's door
{hey man) {*chk-chk-Boom*} That's the sound of the glock
Even Dj Houseshoes fucked around and got shot
I done messed around, and forget my tec
I don't see nobody, but Fat Five and Hex
[Eminem] Kuniva you aight?
[Kuniva] These niggaz is trippin
[Eminem] Where's Bizarre at?
[Kuniva]
I'm tryin to slip through the exit and get to where my car is at
Bitches screamin everywhere and niggaz is whylin
Two minutes ago we was all jokin and smilin
This chick is clingin on to me, sobbin and sighin
Sayin she didn't mean to diss me earlier and she cryin
But it's real and it's on and caps is gettin peeled
So I hugged her and used her body as a human shield and
{*blam* Ahh!} She got hit and now she's yellin {Don'T Leave Me!}
I told her I'd be right back and the dumb bitch believed me
I squeezed through the back door and made my escape
I ran and got my .38 I hope it's not too late!
[Chorus]
[Kon Artis] I been tryin to call you all day motherfucker where you at?
[Swifty Mc] I'm on 7 Mile {*gunfire*} what the fuck was that?

[Swifty Mc] It was a black Mitsubishi
[Kon Arist] Shit, that's the click we beefin with
[Swifty Mc] Maaaaan!
[Kon Artis] I swear
[Swifty Mcvey]
And I was on my way there
Believe me, I'm leavin a carcass today
And I'ma park my car and walk the rest of the way
I'm in the mood to strut, my Ak ain't even tucked
I'ma meet you at the club, we gon' fuck these hoes up!
[Chorus]
[Eminem]
I never seen no shit like this in my life before
People are still camped out from the night before
Sleepin outside the door, waitin in line still
tryin to get inside the club to see D-12 perform
The fire marshalls know, the venue's too small
People are wall to wall, three thousand and some odd
fans and some cumwad from out the parking lot
Gets in an argument over a parking spot
Decides to pull his gun and lets a few of them off
Missed who he's aimin for, six feet away is the door
into St. Andrew's Hall, now the strays flyin all over the place
Grazed one bitch in the face
Another one of 'em came through the wall
Before anyone could even hear the first shot go off
I'm posted up at the bar, havin a mazeltov
Bullet whizzed right by my ear, damn near shot it off
Thank God I'm alive, I gotta find Denaun
And where the fuck is Von? He usually tucks one on him
Wait a minute, I think I just saw Bizarre
Nah I guess not, what the fuck? Oh my God, it was!
I never saw him run so fast in my life
Look at him haulin ass, I think he left his wife
There she is, on the ground, bein trampled
I go to grab her up by the damn hand, but I can't pull her
{*blam*} God damn, there just went another damn bullet
I'm hit, my vest is barely able to handle it
It's too thin, if I get hit again I can't do it
I scoop D, follow Bizarre's path, ran through it and
made it to the front door and collapsed
on the steps looked up and I seen Swift
Shootin it out but I can't see who he's shootin it out with
But Denaun's right behind him, squeezin his four-fifth
[Chorus]
[Kon Artis]
Yo, it's a Friday night, came to this bitch right
Big ass on my left, hand Desert Eagle in my right
I ain't come in this bitch to party, I came in this bitch to fight
Although I can't stay here to fight cause I'm poppin niggaz tonight
That's right bitches I'm drunk with revenge
Shot a bouncer in the neck for tryin to check when I get in
Swift told me to meet him here, so it's clear that the schmuck
that shot out the back of his truck is up in this motherfucker
So one shot for the money, two is to stop the show
The third's for the bartender (bitch bring me a bottle of Mo')
I just wanna know who drivin the black Mitsubishi?
He tried to run, so Proof shot him in the knee with a three-piece

You're 'bout to witness hip hop in its most purest
most rawest form flow, almost flawless
most hardest, most honest, known artist
Chip off the old block but old Doc' is back
Looks like Batman brought his own Robin
Oh God, Saddam's got his own Laden
wit' his on private plane, his own pilot
Set to blow college dorm room doors off the hinges
Oranges, peach, pears, plums syringes {*Vrrm vrrm*}
Yeah here I come
I'm inches away from you, dear fear none
Hip hop is in a state of 911 so...

Hell yeah!

Quick gotta move fast, gotta perform miracles
Gee willikers, Dre, holy bat syllables
Look at all the bullshit that goes on in Gotham
when I'm gone
Time to get rid of these rap criminals
So skip to your lou while I do what I do best
You ain't even impressed no more, you're used to it
Flows too wet, nobody close to it
nobody says it but still everybody knows the shit
the most hated on out of all those
who say they get hated on in eighty songs
and exaggerate it all, so much they make it all up,
there's no such thing
like a female with good looks, who cooks and cleans
It just means so much more to so much more
People when you're rappin' and you know what for,
the show must go on
So I'd like to welcome y'all to Marshall and Andre's carnival,
come on! Now...

It's just like old times, the dynamic duo
Two old friends, why panic?
You already know who's fully capable, the two capped heroes
Dial straight down the center 8-0-0
You can even call collect, the most feared duet
Since me and Elton, played career Russian Roulette
And never even see me blink or get to bustin' a sweat
People stepping over people
just to rush to the set
Just to get to see an MC who breathes so freely,
ease over these beats and be so breezy
Jesus how can shit be so easy?
How can one Chandra be so Levy?
Turn on these beats MC's don't see me
Believe me, BET and MTV
are gonna grieve when we leave, dawg fo' sheezy
Can't leave rap alone the game needs me
Till we grow beards, get weird,
and disappear into the mountains
Nothing but clowns down here
But we, ain't fucking around 'round here
Yo Dre!

What up?

Can I get a hell?

Bump Heads,The Singles Box Set,2003,"(feat. 50 Cent, G-Unit)
[50 Cent]
Yeah, Shady, Hahahaha
G G G G G G G G-Unit
[Eminem]
Here we go again
[50 Cent]
Does it make you mad when I switch my flow?
You can't understand how I get my dough
50 Cent I'm on fire cause Shady said so
I'm on fire
Everybody's in a rush try to get the throne
I just get on the track and try to set the tone
I ain't tryna use nobody as a steppin stone
But don't compare me
I'm better off jus' left alone
And I ain't even tryna go there wit record sales
I'm just tryna keep it humble and respect myself
Say what up, keep steppin, and just rep D-12
Keep my nose clean, stay away from weapons, jail
And livin wreckless
But if you go check my belt
You may see something else I used to protect myself
A vest, to stop a Rueger and deflect the shells
And send 'em back at you faster than they left the barrel
And I don't even carry guns no more, I don't got to
Got undercover cops that'll legally pop you
And I done seen a lot of people cross the line
But this motherfucker Ja musta lost his mind
That X, got him thinkin' he was DMX
Then he switched to 'Pac now he's tryna be him next
So which one are you? X, Luther, Pac or Michael
Juss keep singin' the same song, recycled
We'd all much rather get along and fight you
Me and Hailie danced to your songs we liked you
And you don't really wanna step inside no mic booth
C'mon now, you know the white boy'll bite you
I hurt your pride dawg and you know I don't like to
But I will if I have to, with syllable after syllable I just slap you
Killin' you fasta than you poppin' pill afta little pill of them tabs of that shit you on
But if you want it you got it you'd bump this shit too, if we ain't diss you on it
But if we lock horns we can charge harder than Busta
We bump heads wit any motherfucker that wants to
So whats the, deal where was all the tough talk?
When I walked up to you like, Ja what up dawg?
How come you didn't say you had a problem then?
When you was standin' there wit all your men, we coulda solved this then
I'ma grown man dawg come holla
All you did was slapdance, smile and swallow,
another one of them little X pills in front of me
And tell me 50 Cent was everything you wanna be come on
[50 Cent]
[Chorus]
I know you don't want it with me
You know you don't want it with me
You, talk an' you soon will see
You don't wanna bump heads with me
I know you don't want it with me
You, talk an' you soon you will see
You know you don't want it with me
[Tony Yayo]
You couldn't son me if my father helped you
My punchlines is hot, my bars'll melt you
Ja you Stuart Little, shells'll lift you
Every other week I'm buyin a new pistol
I clap at your ass with this chrome 38
And put six thru your hats of seven 3/8
Irv you ain't Suge Knight, you should shook night
I put my knife in ya wind pipe and freeze ya on the turnpike
You know and I know who took ya chain
You got robbed two times so ya ass is laid
I'm down to die for this shit all I need is bail
You betta stick to tha movies with Steven Seigel, bitch
[50 Cent]
[Chorus]
I know you don't want it with me
You know you don't want it with me
You, talk an' you soon will see
You don't wanna bump heads with me
I know you don't want it with me
You, talk an' you soon you will see
You know you don't want it with me
[Lloyd Banks]
Fuck that I'm miles away
And these industry niggas startin' to get outta hand
I'ma find your whereabouts by stompin' 'em out ya man
Tellin' New York, even in Compton they understand
I'm on the block where you was raised doin' chocolate out tha game an'...
They see me more pop a boy for icey cuz I could
Shootin' guns for money you probably forgot your way around the hood
Bitch when you paranoid it's hard to make a song
Now you want it wit' us, half your artists got to make a point
Every magazine I own your on your knees takin' prayer picture
And you ain't even got shot yet, you scared bitches
You don't know nuttin' about what pain is sucka
I'll put your ass to the ground like a train conductor, muh'fucker
[50 Cent]
[Chorus]
I know you don't want it with me
You know you don't want it with me
You, talk an' you soon will see
You don't wanna bump heads with me
I know you don't want it with me
You, talk an' you soon you will see
You know you don't want it with me

8 Mile,The Singles Box Set,2003,"(It's okay, it's okay. I'm gonna make it anyway)
Sometimes I just feel like
Quittin I still might
Why do I put up this fight?
Why do I still write?
Sometimes it's hard enough just dealin' with real life
Sometimes I wanna jump on stage and just kill mics
And show these people what my level of skill's like
But I'm still white
Sometimes I just hate life
Somethin' ain't right
Hit the break-lights
In case of the stage fright
Draw on the blank light
(Da-duh-duh-da-da, But if I fall,
It ain't my fault, My insides crawl)
And I clam up (Smash!)
I just slam shut
I just can't do it
My whole manhood's just been stripped
I've just been ripped
So I must been dipped
Get of the bus then split
Man fuck this shit yo
I'm goin the fuck home
World on my shoulders as
I run back to this 8 Mile Rd.
Chorus
I'm a man
I'ma make a new plan
Time for me to stand up and travel new land
Time for me to just to take matters into my own hands
Once I'm over these tracks man
I'ma never look back
(8 Mile Rd.)
And I'm gone
I know where I'm goin
Sorry mama I've grown
I must travel alone
Ain't no followin no footsteps
I'm makin my own
Only way I know how to escape from this 8 Mile Rd.
Walkin these train tracks
Tryin to regain back the spirit I have
'Fore I go back to the same crap (Smash!)
To the same plant
And the same pants
Tryin to chase rap
Gotta move A.S.A.P.
Get a new plan
Mama's got a new man
Poor little baby sister
She don't understand
Sits in front of the Tv,
bury's her nose in the pad
And just colors until the crayon gets dull in her hand
While she colors her big brother,
her mother, and dad
Ain't no tellin what really goes on in her little head
Wish I could be the daddy that neither one of us had
But I keep runnin from somethin I never wanted so bad
Sometimes I get upset
Cuz I ain't blew up yet
It's like I grew up, but I aint grownin two nuts yet
Don't gotta rep my step
Don't got enough pep
The pressure's too much man
I'm just tryin to do what's best
And I try
Sit alone and I cry
Yo I won't tell a lie
Not a moment goes by
That I don't pray to the sky
Please I'm beggin you God
Please don't let me be pigeon holed in regular job
Yo I hope you can hear me hommie
Wherever you are
Yo I'm tellin you dog
I'm bailin this trailer tomorrow
Tell my mother I love her
Kiss baby sister goodbye
Say whenever you need me baby
I'm never too far
But yo, I gotta get out there
The only way I know
And I'ma be back for you
On the second that I blow
On everything I own
I'll make it on my own
Off to work I go
Back to this 8 Mile Rd.
Chorus
I'm a man
I'ma make a new plan
Time for me to stand up and travel new land
Time for me to just to take matters into my own hands
Once I'm over these tracks man
I'ma never look back
(8 Mile Rd.)
And I'm gone
I know right where I'm goin
Sorry mama I've grown
I must travel alone
Ain't no followin no footsteps
I'm makin my own
Only way I know how to escape from this 8 Mile Rd.
Ya gotta live it to feel it
If you didn't you wouldn't get it
We'll see what the big deal is
Why it wasn't, it still is
To be walkin this border line of Detroit city's limit
It's different, it's a certain significant
certificate of authenticity
You'd never even see
But it's everything to me
It's my credibility
You've never seen, heard, smell,
or met an Mc
Who's incredible and on the same pedistal as me
But check
Still unsigned
Havin a rough time
Sit on the porch with all my friend's
who kick dumb rhymes
Go to work
And servin Mc's in the lunch line
But when it come's crunch time
Where do my punch lines go?
Who must I show to bust my flow?
Where must I go?
Who must I know?
Or am I just another crab in the bucket
Cuz I ain't havin no luck with this little rabbit so fuck it
Maybe I need a new outlit
I'm startin to doubt shit
I'm feelin a little septicole
Of who I hang out with
I look like a bum
Yo my clothes ain't about shit
At the Salvation Army
Tryin to salvage an outfit
And it's cold
Tryin to travel this road
Plus I feel like I'm only stuck in this battlin mode
My defenses are so up
And one thing I don't want
Is pity from no one
The city is no fun
There is no sun
And it's so dark
Sometimes I feel like I'm just being pulled apart
Being torn in my limbs
By each one of my friends
Enough to just make me wanna jump outta my skin
Sometimes I feel like a robot
Sometimes I just know not
what I'm doin
I just blow
My head is a stove top
I just explode
The kettle gets so hot
Sometimes my mouth just overloads
the acid I don't got
But I've learned
It's time for me to U-Turn
Yo it only takes one time for me to blow up
Ain't no fallin
The next time I meet a new girl
I can no longer play stupid
Or be Immature
I've got every ingredient
All I need is the courage
Like I already got to beat
All I need is the words
Got the urge
Suddenly its a search
Suddenly a new verse of energy has occurred
Time to show these free world leaders
Three in the third
I am no longer scared now
I'm free as a bird
And I turn and cross over
The median curb
Hit the burbs and all you see is a blur on 8 mile rd.
Chorus
I'm a man
I'ma make a new plan
Time for me to stand up and travel new land
Time for me to just to take matters into my own hands
Once I'm over these tracks man
I'ma never look back
(8 Mile Rd.)
And I'm gone
I know right where I'm goin
Sorry mama I've grown
I must travel alone
Ain't no followin no footsteps
I'm makin my own
Only way I know how to escape from this 8 Mile Rd."
Rabbit Run,The Singles Box Set,2003,"[Verse 1]
Some days I just wanna up and call it quits
I feel like im surrounded by a wall of bricks
Everytime I go to get up, I just fall in pits
My life's likes one great big ball of sh*t
If I could just, put it all in the all I spit
Instead of always trying to swallow it
Instead of staring at this wall and sh*t
While I sit, writers block, sick of all this sh*t
Cant call it sh*t, all I know is im about to hit the wall
If I have to see another one of mom’s alcoholic fits
This is it, last straw, that’s all, that’s it
I aint dealing with another f*ckin politic
Im like a skillet bubbling until it filters up
im about to kill it, I can feel it building up
blow this building up, I’ve concealed enough
my cup runneth over, I dun filled it up,
the pen explodes and busts, ink spills my guts
you think all I do is stand here and feel my nuts,
well imma show you what, you gonna feel my rush
you don’t feel it, then it must be too real to touch
p, im about to tear sh*t up
goosebumps, yeah, imma make your hairs sit up
yeah sit up, imma tell you who I be
imma make you hate me, cos you aint me
you wait, it aint too late to finally see
what you closed-minded f*cks, what you blind to see
whoever finds me is gonna get a finders fee
out this world, aint no one out there mind as me
u need peace of mind? Here’s a piece of mine
all I need’s a line,
but sometimes I don’t always find the words to rhyme
to express how Im really feeling at that time, yea
sometimes, sometimes, sometimes
just sometimes, it’s always me
how dark can these hallways be?
The clock strikes midnight, one, two, then half past three
This half-assed rhyme, with this half-assed piece Of paper,
[Verse 2]
im desperate at my desk
If I could just get the rest of this sh*t off my chest again
Stuck in a slum, can't think of nothing
F*ck im stuck, but wait, here comes something
Nope, not good enough, scribble it out, new pad,
drink a lid up and throw the sh*t out
im fizzling out, thought I figured it out
ball’s in my court, but im scared to dribble it out
im afraid, but why am I afraid, why am I a slave to this trade?
Sign that I spit to the grave, real enough to rowl you up
Want me to flip it, I can rip it any style you want
Ima switch, hit a b*tch, jimmy smith aint a quitter
ima sit it here till i get enough of me to finally hit
a f*cking boiling point, put some oil on your joints,
flip the coin b*tch, come get destroyed,
an emcees worst dream, i make em jinx,
they hate me, see me and shake like a changling fence,
by the looks of em you would swear that jaws was comin,
by the screams of him, you would swear im sawwin someone,
by the way they running, you would swear the law was comin,
Its now or never, and tonight its all or nothing,
mama jimmy keeps leaving on us, he said hed be back,
he pinky promised, i dont think hes honest,
ill be back baby, i just gotta beat this clock
f*ck this clock, ima make them eat this watch,
dont believe me watch, ima win this race,
and ima come back and rub my sh*t in your face b*tch,
i found my nitch, you gunna hear my voice,
till ur sick of it, you aint gunna have a choice,
if I gotta scream till I have half a lung,
If I have half a chance ill grab it, Rabbit Run..."
Stimulate,The Singles Box Set,2003,"Listen Now! -
Psst..
Hey, Listen
I love my job
It makes me feel like... superman
Can you fly?
I can
Wanna see?
[Chorus]
I'm only entertaining you my
Goal is to stimulate making you high
And take you and I, to a place that you can't see
But I believe you can fly
I don't need nobody home I'm just partying
I'm not your dad, not your mom, not your guardian
Just a man whos on the mic, so let me... entertain you
[Verse 1]
My lyrical content is constantly undefined
No wonder why I constantly bomb back
To combat attacks with constant concepts
From lyrics constantly took out of context
Failure to communicate with congresses
Been a problem for the longest I guess but
Maybe one day we can make some progress
Food for thought see how long it takes to digest
Feeling good when I should be ashamed
Shit, I really should've fell when I stood
See I came like a flame in the night
Like a ghost in the dark, there's a ray, there's a light
There's a hope there's a spark
But when planets collide, they'll never see eye to eye
Until they decide to set the differences aside
And this is why only one of us will survive
So children, follow my lead and feel the vibe because
[Chorus x1]
[Verse 2]
My music can be slightly amusing
You shouldn't take lyrics so serious
It might be confusing
Trying to seperate the truth from entertainment
It's stupid ain't it?
I get sick of trying to explain it
See I can sit and argue with you but it goes beyond
Just being a snot, pointy nosed, bleached blonde
Cuz' I came here to uplift let your woes be gone
Tell em' to get fucked and just mosey on
Constantly movin' constantly using the constitution
As a form of restitution
Bless the children, nothing less than brilliant
Let me entertain you like Robbie Williams
I'll be here when y'all are gone re-building
We're all revolving, still evolving, still Slim
How many kids will cop me?
Probably millions
But Im'a do this as a fuckin' hobby till then...
[Chorus X1]
[Verse 3]
My lyrical content contains subject matter
That sucks up all these fucked up young kids
Out of a long and great common denominate
Add it up and you'll see thats why I dominate
I try to stimulate but kids imulate
And mimmick ever move you make
""Slim you're great""
But wait, can't you see im only here to entertain?
I gotta be the one to go against the grain
Cuz man, I see it, feel it, live it
But its inhumane for me to see you be influenced
And pretend you ain't
But they don't understand that i've been through pain
If you get to know me I can be a friend you gain
But you can't just stand there and try to touch
It hurts but your jealousy probably tears you up inside as much
And its such a pleasure every button that I touch
I treasure every glutton that I punish in my lust
But i'm"

Meet Eddie, twenty-three years old.
Fed up with life and the way things are going,
he decides to rob a liquor store.
(""I can't take this no more, I can't take it no more homes"")
But on his way in, he has a sudden change of heart.
And suddenly, his conscience comes into play...
[Dr. Dre]
Alright, stop! (Huh?)
Now before you walk in the door of this liquor store
and try to get money out the drawer
You better think of the consequence (But who are you?)
I'm your mother_______ conscience
[Eminem]
That's nonsense!
Go in and gaffle the money and run to one of your aunt's cribs
And borrow a damn dress, and one of her blonde wigs
Tell her you need a place to stay
You'll be safe for days if you shave your legs with an aged razor blade
[Dr. Dre]
Yeah but if it all goes through like it's supposed to
The whole neighbourhood knows you and they'll expose you
Think about it before you walk in the door first
Look at the store clerk, she's older than George Burns
[Eminem]
Funk that! Do that ____! Hit that lick!
Can you afford to blow this pit? Are you that rich?
Why you care if you scare her to death? Are you that chick?
Do you really think she gives a ____ you have kids?
[Dr. Dre]
Man, don't do it, it's not worth it to risk it! (You're right!)
Not over this list
[Eminem]
Stop!
[Dr. Dre]
Drop the biscuit (I will!)
Don't even listen to Slim yo, he's bad for you
[Eminem]
You know what Dre? I don't like your attitude!
Sung:-
These voices, these voices!
I hear them! (hear them, hear them, hear them)!
I'll follow!
I'll follow!
I'll follow!
I'll follow all these voices!

Meet Stan, twenty-one years old.
After meeting a young girl at a rave party,
things start getting hot and heavy in an upstairs bedroom.
Once again, his conscience comes into play.
<singing part stops>
[Eminem]
Now listen to me, while you're kissin' her cheek
and smearin' her lipstick, I slipped this in her drink
Now all you gotta do is nibble on this little chicken's earlobe!
[Dr. Dre]
Yo! This girl's only fifteen years old
How could you take advantage of her?
She's passed out!
[Eminem]
It's easy, just cut these lights out!
That's how!
Then pick this chicken up
Get her off Brad's couch
And leave her on the front porch
At her mum and dad's house!
[Dr. Dre]
Man, ain't you ever seen that one movie ""Kids""?)
[Eminem]
No, but I seen the porno with SunDoobiest (Doobiest)!
[Dr Dre]
Do you wanna get hauled off to jail?
[Eminem]
Funk that, drop her off, ring the door bell then bail.
Sung:-
These voices, these voices!
I hear them! (hear them, hear them, hear them)!

Meet Grady, a twenty-nine year old construction worker.
After coming home from a hard day's work,
he walks in the door of his trailer park home
to find his wife in bed with another man.

[Dr. Dre]
Alright calm down, relax, start breathin'
[Eminem]
Start breathin'?!
Man, you just caught your wife cheatin'!
While you at work she's with some dude tryin' to get off?!
Forget gettin' divorced!
CUT THIS CHICKEN'S HEAD OFF!!!
[Dr. Dre]
Wait! What if there's a good explanation for this?
[Eminem]
What? She tripped? Fell? Landed on his ____?!
[Dr. Dre]
Alright Shady, maybe he's right Grady
But think about the baby before you get all crazy
[Eminem]
Okay! Thought about it, still wanna grab her?
Kick her out the house, get your daughter and kidnap her?
That's what I did, be smart, don't be a retard
You gonna take advice from somebody who slapped DEE BARNES??!
[Dr. Dre]
What'chu say?
[Eminem]
What's wrong? Didn't think I'd remember?
[Dr. Dre]
I'ma kill you mother_____!
[Eminem][Interupting]
Uhhh-aahh! Temper temper!
Mr. Dre? Mr. N.W.A.?
Mr. AK comin' straight outta Compton y'all better make way?
How in the hell you gonna tell this man not to be violent?

Cause he don't need to go the same route that I went
Been there, done that.. aw ____ it...

Hand me an 8 beam me up and land me in space
i'ma sit on top of the world and shit on brandy and mase
im more then ill scarier then a white journalist in a room with lauryn hill
human horror film
but with a lot funnier plot and people who feel me cuz i'ma still be the mad rapper weather i got money or not as long as im on pills and i got plenty of pot i'll be in a cannoe paddling making fun of your yatch
but i would like an award for the best rapper to get one mic and a source
and a woredrobe i can afford otherwise i might just send up
\""pack striking at ford\"" and you wonder what the fuck i need more vicoden for
everybody's pissing me off even a No Limit tank looks like a middle finger sideways flipping me off
no shit im in grave danger to my health why else would i kill you then jump in a grave and bury myself
Course
im the illest rapper to hold the \""cordless\"" patroling corners looking for hookers to punch in the mouth with a roll of quarters
im meaner in action then \""rosco\"" beating james \""star\"" Sr. across the back with vaccuum cleaner attachments
i grew up in a wild hood as a hazardous youth with a fucked up childhood that i use as an excuse and ain't shit changed i kept the same mindstate
since the 3rd time i failed 9th grade
you probably think im a negative person dont be so sure of it i dont promote violence i just encourage it i laugh at the sight of death as i fall down a cement flight of steps and land aside a bed of spider webs
so throw caution to the wind you and a friend can jump off of a bridge and if you live do it again (Shit) why not blow your brain out im blowing mine out fuck it you only live once you might as well die now [just let it go]
Course
my laser disc will make you take a razor to your wrist Make you satanistic
Make you take the pistol to your face
And place the clip and cock it back
And let it go until your brains
are rippin' out your skull so bad
to sew you back and be a waste of stitches
I'm not a Role Model, I don't wanna babysit kids
I got one little girl, and Hailey Jade is Shady's business
And Shady's just an alias I made to make you pissed off
Where the fuck were you when Gil was payin me to dishwash
I make a couple statements and now look how crazy shit got
You made me get a bigger attitude than 80 Kim scotts
And she almost got the same fate that Grady's bitch got
I know that Just the Two of Us would make you hate me this much
And Just the Two of Us
That ain't got shit to do with us and our personal life
It's just words on a mic.
So you can call me a punk, a pervert or a chauvinist pig
But the funny shit is that I still go with the bitch"
Get You Mad,The Singles Box Set,2003,"Artist: Sway and King Tech f/ Eminem
Yo.. yo! (* Eminem hachs up spit *)
Mic check.. (My dick!)
Testing.. one, two (* Eminem hach-spits on mic *)
Ffff-fuck.. (My dick!) My nuts..
My attitude is worse than NWA's was
I'll battle you over stupid shit and diss people
who ain't have shit to do with it, like Cool J does (My tattoo!)
You see me standin outside of your buildin; screamin,
""Puffy is good, (HEY!) but Slim Shady is for the children!"" (WAIT!)
I look at my life in a new light -- fuck it
Give me two mics; I write songs for me -- fuck what you like
You're probably hear me rap half-hearted; cause I don't like rap anyway
I'm just tryin to get my porno career started
Every place and event.. +Been There, Done That+
Shit, Dre stuck me in a suitcase when he went
(* zipper sound *) ""Come on, let's go!""
Want a deal? Study these 5 chapters
Lesson One: Throw demos as hard as you can at signed rappers
Lesson Two: Face em and diss em (whattup dog?)
Don't give em a demo; kidnap em (I want you to come with me)
and make em come to your basement and listen
(you're gonna fuckin check this out)
Lesson Three: Get a job at a label; switch demos with Canibus
and put yours on the owner's table (here listen!)
Lesson Four: 'Know you heard this before'
""Hey let me get your number; I'll call you tomorrow, for sure!""
Don't act like a fan -- you wanna get signed?
Get the whitest A&R you can find
Pull him aside and rap as wack as you can
Lesson Five: Get a hook-up at Jive
Dress up like I.C.P. and have them come see you perform live
And that's the key, but when you see me on the street; I ain't
givin you shit bitch - don't even bother askin me (get away from me)
Toilet water splashes me right in the ass when I'm spittin
cause I'm always shittin when I'm rappin like Master P (UNNNGGGGH!)
Got a blowjob from Paula Jones, and stuffed it so far in her mouth
my balls broke both of her collarbones (OWW!)
Told Mya this shit was all about me-ah (""It's all about me.."")
Gave Alyssa Milano syphillis, mono and gonorrhea (""You're a dick!"")
And all three of my main girls said SEE-YA
Cause Brandy and Monica walked in and caught me fuckin Aaliyah
(What? Oh my God!) I splish splash while I'm takin a bath
Grab a handful of pills, break em in half, take em and laugh
White trash -- fuckin your wife in the ass (""Oh! Ooh Shady! Oooh!"")
While you're out siphoning gas for your lawnmower to cut the grass
So if I hurt your self-esteem
and you get dissed too bad [Yo why you diss me?]
You know I just be sayin that to get you mad
And when I rap about a buncha shit you wished you had [A big dick!]
You know I just be sayin that to get you mad
""I can't listen to that song, that shit's too sad!""
You know I just be sayin that to get you mad
""He'll never make it, his wrist is slit too bad!"" [Nurse! Nurse!]
You know I just be sayin that to get you mad
What a wonderful day; I should go outside and play
Ain't no need to sit inside the house and hibernate
Hi Renee! (Oh hi!) I was just about to toss a live grenade
in your driveway (WHAT?) and drive away (* car peels out *)
Are you afraid of a blade made of a razor with AIDS
Blood drippin from it, rippin your stomach like a paper mache
You talk a lotta shit, but you was never ill though
I'm sick enough to beat you to death with a feather pillow
Tipped over some cows, just for a joke and a laugh (MOOOOO!)
Jumped up, choked a giraffe, snapped his neck and broke it in half
Wagin wars, went on stage and sprayed Cage with +Agent Orange+
And wiped my ass with his page in Source (Here!)
The demon is here, steamin this year
I rip [*Mystikal's*] voicebox out, scream in his ear (AHHHHHH!)
It's not a gimmick bitch, it's an image I live it
Give a fuck? I don't know what a fuck is to give it
""Yeah I don't think this guy is well.."" I'm high as hell
I'll beat you with a live cat when I'm swinging him by his tail
[* impersonating Method Man *]
I'll fuckin, I'll fuckin
Lay your nuts on the dresser
Just your nutsack by itself
And bang them shits with a spiked bat
Cut your neck off and sew your head right back
And leave you like that
You just triggered the prick who just mixed liquor
Who's itchin to leave you disfigured and stiffer than Chris-topher
Reeves, I was teething with strep throat
while your mother was breastfeeding
And gave her the flesh-eating disease
I'm iller than takin a hammer and beatin your knees
and walkin through South Central L.A., bleedin in jeans
(Am I a Blood or a Crip?) Wakin up the next day in breathin machines
Flashin back to being shot and repeatin the scenes
on how you just got smoked, and if you do live
You'll be too scared to tell it, like a Biggie and 'Pac joke
So if I hurt your self-esteem and you get dissed too bad
You know I just be sayin that to get you mad
And when I rap about a fat bitch that you wished you had
You know I just be sayin that to get you mad
""I can't listen to that song, that shit's too sad""
You know I just be sayin that to get you mad
""He'll never make it, his wrist is slit too bad""
You know I just be sayin that to get you mad
I know that makes you real mad, don't it? (uh-huh)
That's right, Slim Shady (yup) Sway & Tech
Sprayin wreck (bitch)
And we don't give a heck (uh-uh)

My nine is limpin ya six deep when i spray rounds
Hit you with 12 shots in mid air and four more on the way down
The eight straight strays to a kid's hair on the playground
You lay down on a stretcher (Don't get carried away now!)
No pun intended, snapped out of your whip
And leave it un-attended before i whip out this gun and hit it
Unless you want it dented with bullet holes any minute
Cause i can leave your Infinite full of those even if someone's in it

What the fuck this guy on the corner been selling you?

Mispelling you, break you and put the fear of hell in you
Escape above you, stuff the nurse in a purse

Driving off, leaving the murdered virgin at church
The first person searching the earth for the motherfucker
That pulled the plug when they shoulda alerted the surgeon first
You don't curse and hit with your own words
Leave me alone bitch! I get on my own nerves

Don't play with da-da's toy knife, honey, let go of it (no!)
And don't look so upset, why you actin bashful?
Don't you wanna help da-da build a sand castle? (yeah!)
And mama said she wants to show you how far she can float
And don't worry about that little boo-boo on her throat

Cause mama's got a new husband and a stepson
And you don't want a brother do ya? (Nah)
Maybe when you're old enough to understand a little better
I'll explain it to ya
But for now we'll just say mama was real real bad
She was bein mean to dad and made him real real mad
But I still feel sad that I put her on time-out
Sit back in your chair honey, quit tryin to climb out
(Wahh!)

But I ain't got rhymes to waste
So let's make 'em
I ain't say I'm a gangsta
I ain't got to start frontin'
I just get Banks up
when I need to pop somethin'
I got a friend of mine
named 50 Cent I signed
This shit's official now
the deal is finished and it's time
to get down to this business
Let's gon' get these nicks and dimes
So hurry up and cop G-Unit shit before it's gone
It's like a gold mine
for my man to take nine
And bounce right back, gotta be like Michael Myers
This shit must me a sign
These labels must be blind
Columbia I know this must be fuckin' with they mind
They know they 'bout to cry
'cause they missed out but I
know how to get the dope 'cause Dre gave me a business mind
I say 'em a line
I hit 'em with a 9
I had a empty clip but they ain't check the chamber (Ha!)
CHORUS
I ain't no gangsta
I ain't got to start frontin'
I just call Banks up

But you gon' feel my shit
You gon' hit the stop button
We gon' fuck you up a long time
You gon' get stomped stuntin'

Damn 50

but we just gonna forget 'em
If he don't shut up we'll get 'em
Let Yayo stomp his head and it's all good
'cause we'd rather rap in the letter
pussy play us outta pocket homie
so tell 'em he better be easy
Start some bullshit he'll get his whole crew wet
D-twizzy, Obie, 50 Cent, and G-Unit
Yo he don't want it 'cause

You won't see no picture where his pupils ain't bugged out

Bad Influence,The Singles Box Set,2003,"Chorus One]
{Just pull the plug!}
People say that I'm a bad influence

Hand me an ,8, beam me up and land me in space
I'ma sit on top of the world {I'm here} and shit on Brandy and
Mase
I'm more than ill
I'm scarier than a white journalist in a room with Lauryn Hill
{Ahh!}
Human horror film
but with a lot funnier plot, and people that feel me
cause I'ma still be Madd Rapper, whether I got money or not
{yup}
As long as I'm on pills, and I got plenty of pot
I'll be in a canoe paddlin, makin fun of your yacht
But I would like an award
for the best rapper to get one mic in The Source
and a wardrobe I can afford
Otherwise I might get sent up back-strike in a Ford
And you wonder what the fuck I need more Vicadin for
Everybody's pissin' me off; even the No Limit Tank
looks like a middle finger sideways flippin me off
No shit I'm a great danger to my health
Why else would I kill you then jump in the grave and bury
myself?

I'm the illest rapper to hold the cordless, patrollin corners
Looking for hookers to punch in the mouth with a roll of
quarters
I'm meaner in action than Roscoe beatin James Todd Sr.
across the back with vacuum cleaner attachments {Ow! Ow! Ow!}
I grew up in a wild hood, as a hazardous youth
with a fucked up childhood, that I used as an excuse
And ain't shit changed, I kept the same mindstate
since the third time that I failed 9th grade
You probably think that I'm a negative person, don't be so sure
of it
I don't promote violence, I just encourage it {c'mon}
I laugh at the sight of death
as I fall down a cement flight of steps {ahhhhhhhh!}
and land inside a bed of spider webs
So throw caution to the wind; you and a friend
can jump off of a bridge and if you live, do it again
Shit, why not, blow your brain out, I'm blowin mine out
Fuck it, you only live once, you might as well die now!
[Chorus Three]

People say that I'm a bad influence

My laser disc gon' make you take a razor to your wrist
Make you satanistic, make you take the pistol to your face
and place the clip and cock it back
and let it go until your brains are rippin out
your skull so bad to sew you back would be a waste of stitches
I'm not a ""Role Model,"" I don't wanna babysit kids
I got one little girl, and Hailey Jade is Shady's business
And Shady's just an alias I made to make you pissed off
Where the fuck were you when Gil was paid to make me dishwash?
I make a couple statements and now look how crazy shit got
You made me get a bigger attitude than eighty Kim Scott's
And she almost got the same fate that Grady's bitch got
I knew that ""Just the Two of Us"" would make you hate me this
much
And ""Just the Two of Us,"" that ain't got shit to do with us
and our personal life, it's just words on a mic
So you can call me a punk, a pervert or a chauvinist pig
But the funny shit is that I still go with the bitch!"

And now it's my fault my fault

And met a new wave blonde babe with half of her head shaved
A nurse aid who came to get laid and tied up
with first aid tape and raped on the first date
Susan -- an ex-manic depressive who just moved from Houston
who love booze and alternative music (Whattup?)
Told me she was starvin, I said it wasn't a problem (Nah!)
I got a coupon for this pizza with everything on it
We can double the mushrooms and minus the sausage

Come on Sue, that's nonsense
Who's at the door?? Pizza man!
Who ordered pizza? Wasn't it yours? Nuh uh

Oh shoot, she's tripping..
[G] I need to go puke!! (Bleahh!)
I wasn't tryin to turn this into somethin major
I just wanted to make you appreciate flavor
Susan, stop cryin, I don't hate ya
I'm sorry your father used to chase you and spank you with hangers
So what they locked you in the attic in your dad's house?
That ain't no reason to start wiggin and spaz out
She said,
[G] Help me I think I'm havin a seisure!
I said, ""You're breaking out in hives, let go of the pizza!""
""Would you put it down you're startin to scare me""
She said,
[G] I'm twenty-six years old and I'm not married
I don't even have any kids and I can't cook

We need to get to a hospital 'fore it's too late
Cause I never seen no-one eat as many shrooms as you ate

I'm not your dad, quit tryin to swallow your tongue
Want some gum? Put down the scissors, 'fore you do somethin dumb
I'll be right back just chill baby please?
I gotta go find Dave he majored in allergies
""John, where's Dave at before I bash you?""
[J] He's in the bathroom; I think he's takin a crap dude!

White America,The Eminem Show,2002,"(Prelude)
America! We love you!
How many people are proud to be citizens of this beautiful country of ours?
The stripes and the stars for the rights that men have died for to protect
The women and men who have broke their necks for the freedom of speech the
United States government has sworn to uphold. (Yo I want everybody to
listen to the words of this song) or so we're told...
Verse 1
I never would've dreamed in a million years I'd see, so many motherfuckin'
people who feel like me who share the same views and the same exact beliefs,
it's like a fuckin' army marchin' in back of me So many lives I touch, so
much anger aimed in no particular direction, just sprays and sprays and
straight through your radio waves it plays and plays, till it stays stuck
in your head for days and days who woulda thought, standing in this mirror
bleachin' my hair, with some peroxide, reachin for a t-shirt to wear
that I would catapult to the forefront of rap like this? How could I predict
my words would have an impact like this I must've struck a chord, with
somebody up in the office, cuz Congress keeps telling me I ain't causin'
nuthin' but problems and now they're sayin' I'm in trouble with the government,
I'm lovin' it, I shoveled shit all my life and now I'm dumping it on...
Chorus X2
White America!
I could be one of your kids
White America!
Little Eric looks just like this
White America!
Erica loves my shit
I go to TRL, look how many hugs I get
Verse 2
Look at these eyes, baby blue, baby just like yourself, if they were brown
Shady lose, Shady sits on the shelf but Shady's cute, Shady knew Shady's
dimples would help, make ladies swoon baby, ooh baby! Look at my sales
Lets do the math, If I was black I would've sold half, I aint have to
graduate from Lincoln High School to know that but I could rap, so fuck
school, I'm too cool to go back, gimme the mic, show me where the fuckin'
studio's at When I was underground, no one gave a fuck I was white, no
labels wanted to sign me almost gave up, I was like Fuck it, until I met
Dre, the only one who looked past, gave me a chance, and I lit a fire up
under his ass helped him get back to the top, every fan black that I got
was probably his in exchange for every white fan that he's got Like damn,
we just swapped. Sittin' back lookin' at shit, wow, I'm like my skin is
it starting to work to my benefit now!
Chorus X2
Verse 3
See the problem is I speak to suburban kids who otherwise would of never
knew these words exist whose moms probably woulda never gave two squirts
of piss, till I created so much motherfuckin' turbulence straight out the
tube, right into your living rooms I came, and kids flipped when they knew
I was produced by Dre That's all it took, and they were instantly hooked
right in, and they connected with me too because I looked like them that's
why they put my lyrics up under this microscope, searchin' with a fine
tooth comb, its like this rope waitin' to choke, tightening around my
throat, watching me while I write this, like I don't like this (nope!)
All I hear is: lyrics, lyrics, constant controversy, sponsors working
round the clock, to try to stop my concerts early surely hip hop was
never a problem in Harlem only in Boston, after it bothered the fathers
of daughters starting to blossom so now I'm catchin' the flack from these
activists when they raggin', actin' like I'm the first rapper to smack a
bitch, or say faggot shit, just look at me like I'm your closest pal, the
posterchild, the mother fuckin' spokesman now for...
Chorus X2
Verse 4
So to the parents of America
I am the derringer aimed at little Erica, to attack her character
The ringleader of this circus of worthless pawns
Sent to lead the march right up to the steps of Congress
And piss on the lawns of the White House, to burn the flag and replace it
with a Parental Advisory sticker
To spit liquor in the face in this democracy of hypocrisy
Fuck you Ms. Cheney! Fuck you Tipper Gore! Fuck you with the freest of
speech this divided states of embarassment will allow me to have, Fuck you!
I'm just playin' America, you know I love you..."

Don't be scared, cause there ain't nothing to worry about
Let your hair down
And square dance with me!
[Verse 2]
Yeah, let your hair down to the track, yeah kick on back
Boo! The boogie monster of rap, yeah the man's back
With a plan to ambush this Bush administration
Mush the Senate's face and push this generation
Of kids to stand and fight for the right to say
something you might not like
This white hot light that I'm under,
no wonder I look so sunburnt
Oh no, I won't leave no stone unturned
Oh no, I won't leave, won't go nowhere
Do-si-do, oh, yo, ho, hello there
Oh yeah, don't think I won't go there
Go to the Beirut and do a show there
Yeah you laugh till your mothafucking ass gets drafted
While you're at band camp
Thinking that crap can't happen
Till you fuck around, get an Anthrax napkin
Inside a package wrapped in Saran wrap wrappin'
Open the plastic and then you stand back gaspin'
Fucking assassins hi-jackin' Amtrak's
Crashin' all this terror, America demands action
Next thing you know you've got Uncle Sam's ass askin'
To join the army or what you'll do for their Navy
You just a baby getting recruited at 18
You're on a plane now, eating their food and their baked beans
I'm 28, they gonna take you 'fore they take me
Crazy insane or insane crazy?
When I say Hussein, you say Shady
My views ain't changed, still Inhumane, wait
Arraigned two days late, the date's today, hang me!
[Chorus 2x]
[Verse 3]
Nothing moves me more than a groove that soothes me
Nothing soothes me more than a groove that boosts me
Nothing boosts me more or suits me beautifully
There's nothing you can do to me,
Stab me, shoot me
Psychotic, hypnotic, product I got the antibiotic
Ain't nobody hotter and so on and yada yada
God I talk a lot of hem-de-lay-la-la-la
Oochie walla walla um da dah da dah da
But you gotta gotta
Keep moving, there's more music to make
Keep making new shit, produce hits to break
The monotony, what's gotten into me?
Drugs, rock and Hennessey,
Thug like I'm 'Pac on my enemies
On your knees, Got you under siege
Somebody you would give a lung to be
Hungry like a fucking younger me
Fuck the fee, I can get you jumped for free
Yeah buddy, laugh it's funny
I have the money to have you killed by somebody who has nothin'
I'm past bluffing
Pass the K-Y, let's get ready for some intense serious ass whooping!
[Chorus]
Dr. Dre wants to square dance with me
Nasty Nas wants to square dance with me
X to the Z wants to square dance with me
Busta Rhymes wants to square dance with me
Can-a-bitch won't square dance with me
Fan-a-bitch won't square dance with me

Took the image of a thug, kept shit appealin'/willin' to stick out my neck, for respect if it meant life or death, never live to regret what I said/when you're me, people just want to see, if its true, if its you, what you say in your rap's, what you do/ so they feel, as part of your obligation to fulfill, when they see you on the streets, face to face, are you for real/in confrontation ain't no conversation, if you feel you're in violation, any hesitation'll get you killed/if you feel it, kill it, if you conceal it, reveal it. Being reasonable will leave you full of bullets, pull it, squeeze it/ till its empty, tempt me, push me, pussies, I need a good reason to give this trigger a good squeeze...

Sayin' goodbye, I'm sayin' good bye to Hollywood
Verse 1
I thought I had it all figured out, I did, I thought I was tough enough to stick it out with Kim
but I wasn't tough enough, to juggle two things at once, I found myself layin' on my knees in cuffs
which should've been a reason enough, for me to get my stuff and just leave. How come I couldn't see this shit myself?
it's just me, nobody couldn't see the shit I felt, knowin' damn well she wasn't gonna be there when I fell
to catch me, the minute shit was heated, she just bailed, I'm standin' here swingin' like thirty people by myself
I couldn't even see the millimeter when it fell, turned around saw Gary stashin' the heater in his belt
saw the bouncers rush him and beat him to the ground, I just sold two million records, I don't need to go to jail
I'm not about to lose my freedom over no female, I need to slow down, get my feet on solid ground/so for now I'm...

I, bury my face in comic books, cus I don't want to look at nothin', this world's too much, I've swallowed all I could
If I could swallow a bottle of Tylenol I would, and end it for good, just say goodbye to Hollywood
I probably should, these problems are piling all at once, cus everything that bothers me, I got it bottled up
I think I'm bottomin' out, but I'm not about to give up, I gotta get up, thank God, I got a little girl
and I'm a responsible father, so not a lot of good, I'd be to my daughter, layin' in the bottom of the mud
must be in my blood cus I don't know how I do it, all I know is I don't want to follow in the footsteps
of my dad, cus I hate him so bad, the worst fear that I had was growin' up to be like his fuckin' ass
man if you could understand why I am the way that I am, what do I say to my fans/when I tell 'em (I'm)...

Verse 3
I don't wanna quit, but shit, I feel like this is it, for me to have this much appeal like this is sick
this is not a game, this fame, in real life this is sick, publicity stunt my ass, conceal my fuckin' dick
fuck the guns, I'm done, I'll never look at Gats, if I scrap, I'll scrap like I ain't never whupped some ass
I love my fans, but no one ever puts a grasp on the fact, I've sacrificed everything I have
I never dreamt I'd get to the level that I'm at, this is wack, this is more than I ever coulda asked
everywhere I go, a hat, a sweater hood, or mask, what about math, how come I wasn't ever good at that?
It's like the boy in the bubble, who never could adapt, I'm trapped, if I could go back, I never woulda rapped
I sold my soul to the devil, I'll never get it back, I just wanna leave this game with level head intact
Imagine goin' from bein' a no one to seein', everything blow up and all you did was just grow up mcing
It's fuckin' crazy, cus all I wanted was to give Hailie the life I never had, but instead I forced us to live alienated
so I'm sayin'...

Obie... Yo... Im sick
Damn... You straight dog?
Chorus
That's why I ain't got no time. For these games and stupid tricks
Or these bitches on my dick. That's how dudes be getting sick
That's how dicks be getting drips. Falling victims to this shit
From these bitches on our dicks, fucking chickens with no ribs
That's why I ain't got no time...
Verse 1 (Obie Trice)
Yo, I woke up fucked up off the liquor I drunk. I had a bag of the skunk won in last nights Tunk
pussy residue was on my penis, Denise from the cleaners, fucked me good, you shoulda seen this
big booty bitch, switch unbearable, french roll stylin', body like a stallion
Sizin up the figure while my shit's getting bigger, debatin' on a fuck or do I want to be her nigga
Caressin'this bitch, plus I'm checking out them tits, sippin' on that fine shit I ain't used to buyin'
I gotta hit it from behind, its mandatory, like takin' hoe's money, but that's another story
For surely, the pussy on toast after we toast, her clothes fell like Bishop in Juice
The womb beater, clean pussy eater, insertin' my jock in that spot hotter than the hottest block
Don't Stop! The response I got when I was knockin' it, clock steady tickin', kinky finger lickin'
and can on, semen's at my tip when she moans. I gotta slow down before I cum soon
and work that nigga like a slave owner. When I dropped off my outfit, she knew I wanted to bone her
She foamin' at the lips, the one between them hips, pubic hairs lookin' like some sour cream dip
without the nacho, my dick hit the spot though, pussy tighter than conditions of us black folks
We in the final stretch, the last part of sex. I bust a fat ass nut, then I woke up next
like what the fuck is goin' on here, this bitch evaporated, pussy and all, just picked up and vacated
Now I'm frusturated cuz my dick was unprotected, and Doctor Wesley tellin me I really got that shit
Chorus
Verse 2 (Eminem)
Now I don't wanna hit no woman, but this chick's got it comin', someone better get this bitch, before she gets kicked in the stomach
and she's pregnant, buts she's eggin' me on, beggin' me to throw her off the steps of this porch
my only weapon is force and I don't wanna resort to any violence of any sort. But what's she shovin' me for?
Doesn't she love me no more? Wasn't she huggin' me four minutes ago at the door?
M an, I'm this close to goin' toe-to-toe with this whore. What would you do if she was tellin' you she wants a divorce?
She's havin' another baby in a month, and it's yours, and you find out it isn't cus this bitch has been visitin' someone else
and suckin' his dick and kissin' you on the lips when you get back, to Michigan, now the plot is thickenin' worse
cus you feel like you've been stickin' your fuckin' dick in a hearse
so you paranoid at every little cold that you get, ever since they told you this shit, you've been holdin' your dick
so you go to the clinic, sweatin' every minute you in it, then the doctor comes out lookin' like Dennis the Menace
and it's obvious to everyone in the lobby it's Aids, he ain't even gotta call you in his office to say it
so you jet back home, cus you gon' get that hoe, when you see her, you gon' bend her fuckin' neck back, yo
cus you love her, you never would expect that blow, Obie told you the scoop, how could she stoop that low?
Jesus, I don't believe this, bitch works at the cleaners, bringin' me home diseases, swingin' from Obie's penis
she's so deceivin', shit this hoe's a genius,she g'd us...

Hailie's Song,The Eminem Show,2002,"I can't sing it
I feel like singin'
I wanna (*fuckin'*) sing
'Cuz I'm happy
Yeah, I'm happy
Ha Ha
I got my baby back
Yo, check it out
Verse 1
Somedays I sit (sit), starin' out the window
Watchin' this world pass me by
Sometimes I think (think) there's nothin' to live for (for)
I almost break down and cry
Sometimes I think I'm crazy
I'm crazy, oh so crazy
Why am I here, am I just wastin' my time?
But then I see my baby
Suddenly I'm not crazy
It all makes sense when I look into her eyes (Oh no)
Chorus
Sometimes It feels like the world's on my shoulders
Everyone's leanin' on me
'Cuz sometimes it feels like the world's almost over
But then she comes back to me
Verse 2
My baby girl(girl)(Hailie laughs) keeps gettin' older
I watch her grow up with pride
People make jokes (jokes), 'cuz they don't understand me (me)
They just don't see my real side
I act like (*shit*) don't phase me,
Inside it drives me crazy
My insecurities could eat me alive
But then I see my baby
Suddenly I'm not crazy
It all makes sense when I look into her eyes
Chorus
Verse 3
Yeah and if I could sing, I'd keep singin' this song to my daughter
If I could hit the notes, I'd blow somethin' as long as my father
To show her how I feel about her, how proud I am that I got 'er
God, I'm a daddy, I'm so glad that her mom didn't *censored* (abort her)
Now you prob'ly get this picture from my public persona
That I'm a pistol-packin' drug-addict who bags on his mama,
But I wanna just take this time out to be perfectly honest
'Cuz there's a lot of (*shit*) I keep bottled that hurts deep inside o' ma soul,
And just know that I grow colder the older I grow
This boulder on my shoulder that gets heavy and harder to hold
And this load is like the weight of the world
And I think my neck is breakin' should I just give up
Or try to live up to these expectations? now look,
I love my daughter more than life in itself,
But I got a wife who's determined to make my life livin' hell
But I handle it well, given the circumstances I'm dealt
So many chances, man, it's too bad, coulda had someone else
But the years that I've wasted are nothin' to the tears that I've tasted
So here's what I'm facin': 3 felonies, 6 years of probation
I've went to jail for this woman, I've been to bat for this woman
I've taken bats to people's backs, bent over backwards for this woman
Man, I shoulda seen it comin', what'd I stick my penis up in?
Woulda ripped the pre-nup if I'd seen what she was (*fuckin'*)
But (*fuck*) it, it's over, there's no more reason to cry no more
I got my baby, baby the only lady that I adore, Hailie
So sayonara, try tomorra, nice to know ya
My baby's travelled back to the arms of her rightful owner
And suddenly it seems that my shoulder blades have just shifted
It's like the greatest gift you can get
The weight has been lifted
(Chorus 2)
Now it don't feel like the world's on my shoulders
Everyone's leanin' on me
Cause my baby knows that her daddy's a soldier
Nothin' can take her from me
Outro - Spoken
Woo!
I told you, I can't sing.
Oh well, I tried
Hailie, remember when I said
If you ever need anything, daddy will be right there?
Well guess what, daddy's here.
And I ain't goin' nowhere baby
I love you (kiss)

If I, were to die, murdered in cold blood tommorrow, would you feel sorrow, or show love, or would it matter?
Could never be the lead-off batter if there ain't shit for me to feed off, I'm see-saw battlin'
but there's way too much at stake for me to be fake, there's too much on my plate, I done came way
too far in this game, to turn and walk away, and not say what I got to say
what the fuck you take me for, a joke? You smokin' crack? 'Fore I do that, I'd beg Mariah to take me back
I'll get up 'fore I get down, gun myself in the ground, 'fore I put some wack shit out
I'm tryin' to smack this one out the park, five-thousand mark, y'all steady tryin' to drown a shark
ain't gon' do nothin' but piss me off, lid to the can of whip ass, just twist me off
see me leap out, pull a piece out, fuck shootin', I'm just tryin' to knock his teeth out
fuck with me now bitch, let's see you freestyle, talk is cheap, motherfucker, if you really feelin' froggish, leap
yo Slim, you gon' let him get away with that? He tried to play you, you can't let him skate with that

with real life when the music stops

Ain't no getting' rid of Mcveigh, if so you woulda tried, the only way I'm leavin' this bitch is suicide
I have died clinically, arrived ride back at my enemies' crib with Hennessey, got drunk then I finish him
I'm every nigga's favorite arch enemy, physically fitted to be the most dangerous nigga with beef
I spark willingly, with a dillinger in the dark, dilligently, I'm not what you think
I appear to be fucked up, mentally endangered, I can't stay away from a razor, I just want my face in a paper
I wish a nigga had a grenade to squeeze tight to awake neighbors for acres
I'll murder you, I gauge have me turn into a mad man, son of sam bitch, I'm surgical
I'm allergic to dyin', you think not, you got balls? We can see how large

I was happy havin' a deal at first, thought money would make me happy, but it only made my pain worse
It hurts when you see your friends turn their back on you, dog, and you ain't got nuttin' left but your word and your balls
and you're stressed from the calls of your new friends, beggin' with their hands out, checkin' for your record when it's sellin'
when it ain't that's the end, no laughs, no friends, no girls, just the gin you drink, till your car spin
you think Damn! When you slam into the wall, and you fall out the car and try to crawl with one arm
I'm bout to lose it all, in a pool of alcohol, if my funeral's tomorrow, wonder would they even call

Let's see how many of your men loyal, when I pull up lookin' for you with a pistol, sippin' a can of penzoil
I'm revved up, who said what, when lead bust your head just explode with red stuff, I'm handcuffed
tossed in the paddywagon, braggin' about how you shouted, like a coward, bullets devoured you, showered you niggas
If I was you niggas, I'd run while given a chance, understand, I can enhance the spirit of man
Death itself, it can hurt me, just the thought of dyin' alone that really irks me
you ain't worthy to speak thoughts of cheap talk, be smart and stop tryin' to walk how G's walk before we spark
hug the floor while we playin' tug-of-war with your life, fuck a tour and a mike, I'd rather fuck a whore with a knife
deliver that shit that coroner's like, you hype, poppin' shit in broad daylight, nigga you're a gonner at night
when the music stops
Proof:
Instigators, turn pits in cages, let loose and bit the neighbors, wrist to razors
y'all don't want war, y'all want talk, in the dark, my dogs all bark like woof!
Proof nigga I'ma wolf, get your whole roof, caved in like reindeer hoofs
stomp the booth, shake, the floor tiles loose, the more y'all breath, shit, the more lose moves
It's Hill Street, this is hardcore blues, put a gun to rap check in all our dues
nigga, or make the news, betcha all move, when the uzi pop you better drop
when the music stop
Bizarre:
Music has changed my life in so many ways, brains confused been fucked since the fifth grade
Ll told me rock the bells, Nwa said fuck the police, now I'm in jail
'93 was strictly R&B, fucked haircut, listenin' to Jodeci
Michael Jackson who gonna tell me I ain't Mike? Ass cheeks painted white, fuckin' Priscilla tonight
Flyin' down Sunset smokin' crack, transvestite in the front, Eddie Murphy in the back
Mop had grimy and gritty, Marilyn Manson, I died my hair blue, and grew some titties
Ludacris told me to throw them bows, now I'm in the hospital with a broken nose and a fractured elbow
voices in my head I'm goin' in shock, I'm reachin' for the glock, but the music stops..."
Say What You Say ,The Eminem Show,2002,"Say What You Say
---------------
Intro
(Dre) Oh, so I'm out the game, huh
(Eminem) Yo Dre, we ridin'?
(Dre) Whatever...
(Eminem) Well I'm wit ya homie
(Dre) Okay, well let's handle the small shit
Verse 1
(Eminem) I was born to brew up storms, stir up shit, kick up dust, cuss till I slur up spit/grew up too quick, went through too much, knew too much shit, corrupt, and I'ma pour it on like syrup, bitch/thick 'n rich, sick and twisted, Mr. Buttersworth, Dre told me to milk this shit for what it's worth/till the cow just tilts and tips and stumbles to earth, and if I fumble a verse, keep going, first take/I make mistakes just keep it, no punches pull, no punches, that's weak shit/fake shit, if I ever take shit I'll eat shit, wasn't for him, wouldn't be shit
(Dre) Creep with me as we take a little trip down memory lane, been here longer than anyone in the game/and I ain't got to lie about my age, ""But what about Jermaine?"" Fuck Jermaine, he don't belong speakin' mine or Timbaland's name/and don't think I don't read your lil' interviews and see what you're sayin', I'm a giant, and I ain't gotta move/till I'm provoked, when I see you, I'ma step on you and not even know it/you midget, mini-me with a bunch of mini-yous, runnin' round your backyard swimmin' pools/over eighty million records sold, and I ain't have to do it with ten or eleven year olds
Chorus X2
Cus what you say is what you say, say what you say how you say it whenever you sayin' it/just remember how you said it when you was sprayin' it, so who you playin' wit, huh?
Verse 2
(Eminem) Second verse, it gets worse, it gets no better than this, amatuers drink veteran piss/from a dixie cup, if you ever mix me up or confuse me with a Cannabis or Dre with a Dupri/we'll rub it in, every club you're in, we'll have you black balled and make sure you never rap-a-fuckin'-gain/Dre ain't havin' it as long as I'm here to play devil's advocate
(Dre) If there was some magic shit I could wave over the industry, that could save it when I'm gone and buried/to make sure the tradition carries on, I would
(Eminem) If I could only use this power for good, I wouldn't, not even if I could
(Dre) From the hood, and I'm a hornet, and I'ma only sting when I cornered
(Eminem) And I'ma only sucker punch and swing without warning/and swing to knock somebody's fuckin' head off, cus I know if they get up, I won't get a chance to let off/another punch, I'm punk rock, no one's punk, don't give a fuck, White-Pac, so much spunk/when I was little I knew I would blow up and sell a mill, or grow up to be Atilla, go nuts and be a killer
(Dre) And I'm, somethin' of a phenom, one puff of the chron, I'm unstoppable, I'm alive and on top again/there's no obstacle that I can't conquer so come along wit us·.Cmon
Chorus X2
Verse 3
(Dre) Now anybody who knows Dre, knows I'm about fast cars and Alize, partyin' all day/but I handled my business, cus it' work before play, don't look for trouble, but I'll serve you gourmet/however you want it, you can have it your way, you fuck my night up, I'ma fuck up your day/bullet with your name, sendin' it your way, that goes for anyone who walks through that doorway/cus this is my space, you invade it, live to regret it, and you'll die tryin' to violate it/fuck around, get annihilated, eyes dialated
(Eminem) Like my old lady?/Cus what you say is what you say, sometimes what you mean is two different things, depending on your mood if it swings/think too many things, little hit of Dre's weed, I can do anything, catch a contact and I'm gone/ and I'm back, I speed write and my loose-leaf's my launch pad
(Dre) And I can pull any string, don't have to prove anything/catch a contract on your head, you headed west, talk shit about Dre, you better get a vest/and invest in something to protect your head and neck
(Eminem) And it's back and forth, all day like Red and Meth, I joke when I say I'm the best, in the booth, but a lot of truth is said in jest/and if I ever do live to be a legend I'ma die a sudden death/five mics in the Source, ain't holdin' my fuckin' breath, but I'll suffocate for the respect 'fore I breathe/ to collect a fuckin' check
Chorus X2
Outro
(Dre) Watch your fuckin' mouth
(Timbaland) Yo this Timbaland. Tell'em I said suck·my dick"
My Dad's Gone Crazy ,The Eminem Show,2002,"My Dad's Gone Crazy
Hailie: Daddy what are you doing?
Eminem and Hailie: Okay then! Everybody listen up!
Eminem: I'm goin' to hell! Who's comin' with me?
Hailie: Somebody please help him! I think my dad's gone crazy
There's no mountain I can't climb,
there's no tower too high,
no plane that I can't learn how to fly what do
I gotta do to get through to you,
to show you there ain't nothin'
I can't take this chainsaw to?
Fuckin' brains, brawn and brass balls,
I cut'em off, and got'em pickled and
Bronzed in a glass jar
Inside of a hall
with my framed autographed sunglasses
With Elton John's name
on my Glaad wall,
I'm out the closet, I've been lyin'
My ass off All this time
me and Dre been fuckin' with hats off
(Suck it, Marshall) .
So tell Laura and her husband to back off
before I push this muthafuckin' button and blast off
And launch one at these Russians and that's all blow
every fuckin' thing except Afghanistan on the map off.
When will it stop? When will I knock the crap off?
Hailie, tell 'em baby, (My Dad's Lost It!)
There's really nothin' else to say
I... I can't explain it
(Hailie: I think my dad's gone crazy)
A little help from Hailie Jade
Won't you tell 'em baby
(Hailie: I think my dad's gone crazy)
There's nothin' you could do or say that could ever change me
I think my dad's gone crazy
There's no one on earth that can save me, not even Hailie
(Hailie: I think my dad's gone crazy)
It's like my mother always told me
Rana rana rana rana rana rana rana rana rana rana
and codeine and goddammit you little muthafucker
if you ain't got nuthin' nice to say then don't say nuthin'
·... uh, fuck that shit bitch eat a muthafuckin' dick
chew on a prick and lick a million muthafuckin' cocks
per second, I'd rather put out a muthafuckin'
Gospel record
I'd rather be a pussy whipped bitch,
eat pussy, and have pussy lips glued to my face with
A clit ring
in my nose then quit bringin' my flows quit givin' me
My ammo.
Can't you see why I'm so mean?
If y'all leave me alone this wouldn't be my M. O.
I wouldn't have to go, eenee, meenee, meini, mo
Catch a homo by his toe, man I don't know no more am
I the only fuckin' one who's
Normal any more?

There's no one on earth that can save me, not even Hailie
(Hailie: I think my dad's gone crazy)
My songs can make you cry,
Take you by surprise at the same time,
Can make you dry your eyes with the same rhyme
see what you're seein' is a genius at work,
Which to me isn't work, so it's easy to
Misinterpret it at first cus
when I speak, it's tongue-in-cheek,
I'd yank my fuckin' teeth before I'd ever bite my tongue
I'd slice my gums, get struck by fuckin' lightning
Twice
At once and die and come back as Vanilla Ice's son
And walk around the rest of my life spit on,
And kicked and hit with shit everytime
I sung like R. Kelly as soon as ""Bump and Grind"" comes on.
More pain inside of my brain than
The eyes of a little girl
Inside of a plane aimed at the World Trade,
Standin' on Ronnie's grave,
Screamin' at the sky, till clouds gather,
It's Clyde Mathers and Bonnie Jade and
That's pretty much the gist of it, the parents
are pissed but the kids love it.
9 millimeter heater stashed
In 2 seaters with meat cleavers
I don't blame you,
I wouldn't let Hailie listen to me neither
There's really nothin' else to say
I... I can't explain it

You're Funny Daddy! )"
Till I Collapse ,The Eminem Show,2002,"'Cause sometimes you just feel tired,
Feel weak, and when you feel weak,
you feel like you wanna just give up.
But you gotta search within you,
you gotta find that inner strength
And just pull that shit out of you
and get that motivation to not give up
And not be a quitter,
no matter how bad
you wanna just fall flat on your face and collapse.
Yo left, yo left, yo left right left
Yo left, yo left, yo left right left
Yo left, yo left, yo left right left
Yo left, yo left, yo left right left
[Eminem]
Till I collapse I'm spilling these raps
long as you feel 'em
Till the day that I drop you'll never say
that I'm not killing them
'Cause when I am not then I'ma stop penning 'em
And I am not hip-hop and I'm just not Eminem.
Subliminal thoughts when I'm stop sending them women
are caught in webs spin and hauk venom
Adrenaline shots of penicillin
could not get the illing to stop.
Amoxacilin is just not real enough.
The criminal cop killing hip-hop
filling minimal swap to cop millions of Pac listeners.
Your coming with me, feel it or not
you're gonna fear it like I showed you
the spirit of god lives in us.
You hear it a lot, lyrics the shock
is it a miracle or am I just a product of pop fizzing up.
For shizzle my whizzle this is the plot
listen up you bizzles forgot slizzle does not give a fuck.
[Chorus - Natedogg]
Till the roof comes off, till the lights go out
Till my legs give out, can't shut my mouth.
Till the smoke clears out - am I high? Perhaps
I'ma rip this shit till my bone collapse.
Till the roof comes off, till the lights go out
Till my legs give out, can't shut my mouth.
Till the smoke clears out and my high burn out
I'ma rip this shit till my bone collapse.
[Eminem]
Music is like magic there's a certain feeling
you get when you're real
And you spit and people are feeling your shit.
This is your moment and every single minute
you spend trying to hold onto it
'Cause you may never get it again.
So while you're in it try to get as much shit as you can
And when your run is over
just admit when it's at its end.
'Cause I'm at the end of my wits
with half this shit that gets in.
I got a list here's the order of my list that it's in.
It goes, Reggie, Jay-Z, Tupac and Biggie,
Andre from Outkast, Jada, Kurupt, Nas and then me.
But in this industry I'm the cause of a lot of envy,
so when I'm not put on this list
the shit does not offend me.
That's why you see me walk around
like nothing's bothering me.
Even though half you people
got a fucking problem with me.
You hate it but you know respect you've got to give me
The press's wet dream like Bobby and Whitney.
Nate hit me.
[Chorus - Natedogg]
Till the roof comes off, till the lights go out
Till my legs give out, can't shut my mouth.
Till the smoke clears out - am I high? Perhaps
I'ma rip this shit till my bone collapse.
Till the roof comes off, till the lights go out
Till my legs give out, can't shut my mouth.
Till the smoke clears out and my high burn out
I'ma rip this shit till my bone collapse.
[Eminem]
Soon as a verse starts
I eat it at Mc's heart
What is he thinking?
How not to go against me? Smart.
And it's absurd how people hang on every word.
I'll probably never get the props I feel I ever deserve
But I'll never be served
my spot is forever reserved
If I ever leave earth
that would be the death of me first.
'Cause in my heart of hearts
I know nothing could ever be worse.
That's why I'm clever
when I put together every verse
My thoughts are sporadic,
I act like I'm an addict
I rap like I'm addicted to smack like I'm Kim Mathers.
But I don't want to go forth and back
in constant battles
The fact is I would rather sit back
and bomb some rappers.
So this is like a full blown attack
I'm launching at them
The track is on some battling raps who want some static
'Cause I don't really think
that the fact that I'm Slim matters
A plaque of platinum status is whack
if I'm not the baddest.
[Chorus - Natedogg]
Till the roof comes off, till the lights go out
Till my legs give out, can't shut my mouth.
Till the smoke clears out - am I high? Perhaps
I'ma rip this shit till my bone collapse.
Till the roof comes off, till the lights go out
Till my legs give out, can't shut my mouth.
Till the smoke clears out and my high burn out
I'ma rip this shit till my bone collapse.
Until the roof
The roof comes off
Until my legs
Give out from underneath me
I will not fall,
I will stand tall,
Feels like no one could beat me."

I don't do black music, I don't do white music
I make fight music, for high school kids
I put lives at risk when I drive like this {*tires screech*}
I put wives at risk with a knife like this (AHHH!!)
Shit, you probably think I'm in your tape deck now
I'm in the back seat of your truck, with duct tape stretched out
Ducked the fuck way down, waitin to straight jump out
put it over your mouth, and grab you by the face, what now?
Oh - you want me to watch my mouth, how?
Take my fuckin eyeballs out, and turn em around?
Look - I'll burn your fuckin house down, circle around
and hit the hydrant, so you can't put your burning furniture out
(Oh my God! Oh my God!) I'm sorry, there must be a mix-up
You want me to fix up lyrics while the President gets his dick sucked?
{*ewwww*} Fuck that, take drugs, rape sluts
Make fun of gay clubs, men who wear make-up
Get aware, wake up, get a sense of humor
Quit tryin to censor music, this is for your kid's amusement

You shoulda been watchin him - apparently you ain't parents

Cause I never knew I, knew I would get this big
I never knew I, knew I'd effect this kid

So who's bringin the guns in this country? (Hmm?)
I couldn't sneak a plastic pellet gun through customs over in London
And last week, I seen a Schwarzaneggar movie
where he's shootin all sorts of these motherfuckers with a uzi
I sees three little kids, up in the front row,
screamin ""Go,"" with their 17-year-old Uncle
I'm like, ""Guidance - ain't they got the same moms and dads
who got mad when I asked if they liked violence?""
And told me that my tape taught 'em to swear
What about the make-up you allow your 12-year-old daughter to wear?
(Hmm?) So tell me that your son doesn't know any cuss words
when his bus driver's screamin at him, fuckin him up worse
(""Go sit the fuck down, you little fuckin prick!"")
And fuck was the first word I ever learned
up in the third grade, flippin the gym teacher the bird (Look!)
So read up, about how I used to get beat up
peed on, be on free lunch, and change school every 3 months
My life's like kinda what my wife's like (what?)
Fucked up after I beat her fuckin ass every night, Ike
So how much easier would life be
if 19 million motherfuckers grew to be just like me?
Chorus
[Eminem]
I never knew I.. knew I'd..
have a new house or a new car
A couple years ago I was more poorer than you are
I don't got that bad of a mouth, do I?
Fuck shit ass bitch cunt, shooby-de-doo-wop (what?)
Skibbedy-be-bop, a-Christopher Reeves
Sonny Bono, skis horses and hittin some trees (HEY!)
How many retards'll listen to me
and run up in the school shootin when they're pissed at a
teach-er, her, him, is it you is it them?
""Wasn't me, Slim Shady said to do it again!""
Damn! How much damage can you do with a pen?
Man I'm just as fucked up as you woulda been
if you woulda been, in my shoes, who woulda thought
Slim Shady would be somethin that you woulda bought
that woulda made you get a gun and shoot at a cop
I just said it - I ain't know if you'd do it or not

Came home, and somebody musta broke in the back window

I murder a rhyme one word at a time
You never, heard of a mind as perverted as mine
You better, get rid of that nine, it ain't gonna help
What good's it gonna do against a man that strangles himself?
I'm waiting for hell like hell shit I'm anxious as hell
Manson, you're safe in that cell, be thankful it's jail
I used to be my mommy's little angel at twelve
Thirteen I was putting shells in a gauge on a shelf
I used to, get punked and bullied on my block
'til I cut a kitten's head off and stuck it in this kid's mailbox
{""Mom! Mom!""} I used to give a - fuck, now I could give a fuck less
What do I think of suc-cess? It sucks, too much press I'm stressed
Too much stares two breasts, too upset
It's just too much mess, I guess I must just blew up quick (yes)
Grew up quick (no) was raised right
Whatever you say is wrong, whatever I say is right
You think of my name now whenever you say, ""Hi""
Became a commodity because I'm W-H-I-
-T-E, cuz Mtv was so friendly to me
Can't wait 'til Kim sees me
Now is it worth it? Look at my life, how is it perfect?
Read my lips bitch, what, my mouth isn't working?
You hear this finger? Oh it's upside down
Here, let me turn this motherfucker up right now

I been crazy way before radio didn't play me
The sensational {*vocal scratch ""Back is the incredible!""*}
With Ken Kaniff, who just finds the men edible
It's Ken Kaniff on the, internet
Tryin to, lure your kids with him, into bed
It's a, sick world we live in these days
""Slim for Pete's sakes put down Christopher Reeve's legs!""
Geez, you guys are so sensitive
""Slim it's a touchy subject, try and just don't mention it""
Mind with no sense in it, fried to get so frenetic
whose eyes get so squinted, I'm blind from smoking 'em
with my windows tinted, with nine limos rented
Doin lines of coke in 'em, with a bunch of guys hopping out
all high and indo scented {*inhales, exhales*}
And that's where I get my name from, that's why they call me
Chorus
[Eminem]
I take seven [kids] from [Columbine], stand 'em all in line
Add an Ak-47, a revolver, a nine
a Mack-11 and it oughta solve the problem of mine
and that's a whole school of bullies shot up all at one time
Cause (I'mmmm) Shady, they call me as crazy
as the world was over this whole Y2k thing
And by the way, N'Sync, why do they sing?
Am I the only one who realizes they stink?
Should I dye my hair pink and care what y'all think?
Lip sync and buy a bigger size of earrings?
It's why I tend to block out when I hear things
Cause all these fans screamin is makin my ears ring (Ahhhh!!!)
So I just, throw up a middle finger and let it linger
longer than the rumor that I was stickin it to Christina
Cause if I ever stuck it to any singer in showbiz
it'd be Jennifer Lopez, and Puffy you know this!
I'm sorry Puff, but I don't give a fuck if this chick was my own mother
I still fuck her with no rubber and cum inside her
and have a son and a new brother at the same time
and just say that it ain't mine, what's my name?
Chorus

I'm blew out from this blunt (*sighs*) fuck"
Marshall Mathers,The Marshall Mathers (Deluxe),2002,"You know I just don't get it
Last year I was nobody
This year I'm sellin records
Now everybody wants to come around like I owe em somethin
Heh, the fuck you want from me, ten million dollars?
Get the fuck out of here
Chorus One: Eminem
You see I'm, just Marshall Mathers (Marshall Mathers)
I'm just a regular guy,
I don't know why all the fuss about me (fuss about me)
Nobody ever gave a fuck before,
all they did was doubt me (did was doubt me)
Now everybody wanna run they mouth
and try to take shots at me (take shots at me)
Yo, you might see me joggin, you might see me walkin
You might see me walkin a dead rottweiler dog
with it's head chopped off in the park with a spiked collar
hollerin at him cause the son of a bitch won't quit barkin
(grrrr, ARF ARF) Or leanin out a window, with a cocked shotgun
Drivin up the block in the car that they shot 'Pac in
Lookin for Big's killers, dressed in ridiculous
blue and red like I don't see what the big deal is
Double barrel twelve gauge bigger than Chris Wallace
Pissed off, cause Biggie and 'Pac just missed all this
Watchin all these cheap imitations get rich off 'em
and get dollars that shoulda been there's like they switched wallets
And amidst all this Crist' poppin and wristwatches
I had to sit back and just watch and just get nauseous
and walk around with an empty bottle of Remi Martin
startin shit like some 26-year-old skinny Cartman (""God damnit!"")
I'm anti-Backstreet and Ricky Martin
with instincts to kill N'Sync, don't get me started
These fuckin brats can't sing and Britney's garbage
What's this bitch retarded? Gimme back my sixteen dollars
All I see is sissies in magazines smiling
Whatever happened to whylin out and bein violent?
Whatever happened to catchin a good-ol' fashioned
passionate ass-whoopin and gettin your shoes coat and your hat tooken?
New Kids on the Block, sucked a lot of dick
Boy/girl groups make me sick
And I can't wait 'til I catch all you faggots in public
I'ma love it.. (hahaha)
Vanilla Ice don't like me (uh-uh)
Said some shit in Vibe to spite me (yup)
Then went and dyed his hair just like me (hehe)
A bunch of little kids wanna swear just like me
and run around screamin, ""I don't care, just bite me"" (nah nah)
I think I was put here to annoy the world
and destroy your little 4-year-old boy or girl
Plus I was put here to put fear in faggots who spray Faygo Root Beer
and call themselves ""Clowns"" cause they look queer
Faggot2Dope and Silent Gay
Claimin Detroit, when y'all live twenty miles away (fuckin punks)
And I don't wrestle, I'll knock you fuckin faggots the fuck out
Ask 'em about the club they was at when they snuck out
after they ducked out the back when they saw us and bugged out
(AHHH!) Ducked down and got paintballs shot at they truck, blaow!
Look at y'all runnin your mouth again
when you ain't seen a fuckin Mile Road, South of 10
And I don't need help, from D-12, to beat up two females
in make-up, who may try to scratch me with Lee Nails
""Slim Anus,"" you damn right, Slim Anus
I don't get fucked in mine like you two little flaming faggots!
Cause I'm, just Marshall Mathers (Marshall Mathers)
I'm not a wrestler guy,
I'll knock you out if you talk about me (you talk about me)
Come and see me on the streets alone
if you assholes doubt me (assholes doubt me)
And if you wanna run your mouth
then come take your best shot at me (your best shot at me)
Is it because you love me that y'all expect so much of me?
You little groupie bitch, get off me, go fuck Puffy
Now because of this blonde mop that's on top
and this fucked up head that I've got, I've gone pop?
The underground just spunned around and did a 360
Now these kids diss me and act like some big sissies
""Oh, he just did some shit with Missy,
so now he thinks he's too big to do some shit with MC Get-Bizzy""
My fuckin bitch mom's suin for ten million
She must want a dollar for every pill I've been stealin
Shit, where the fuck you think I picked up the habit?
All I had to do was go in her room and lift up her mattress
Which is it bitch, Mrs. Briggs or Ms. Mathers?
It doesn't matter you {*several seconds of silence*} faggot!
Talkin about I fabricated my past
He's just aggravated I won't ejaculate in his ass (Uhh!)
So tell me, what the hell is a fella to do?
For every million I make, another relative sues
Family fightin and fussin over who wants to invite me to supper
All the sudden, I got 90 some cousins (Hey it's me!)
A half-brother and sister who never seen me
or even bothered to call me until they saw me on TV
Now everybody's so happy and proud
I'm finally allowed to step foot in my girlfriend's house
Hey-hey! And then to top it off, I walked to the newsstand
to buy this cheap-ass little magazine with a food stamp
Skipped to the last page, flipped right fast
and what do I see? A picture of my big white ass
Okay, let me give you motherfuckers some help:
uhh, here - DOUBLE XL, DOUBLE XL
Now your magazine shouldn't have so much trouble to sell
Ahh fuck it, I'll even buy a couple myself"

Drug Ballad,The Marshall Mathers (Deluxe),2002,"girl: Yea...(laughter)...whoooo...shit
hmmm, whoaaa, hmm ...
Guess what?
I ain't coming in yet, i'll come in in a minute
Aiyo, this is my love song. It goes like this....
Back when Mark Walhberg was marky mark
This is how we used to make the party start
We used to...mix in with bacardi dark
and when it... kicks in you can hardely talk
and by the... sixth gin you gon probly crawl
and you'll be... sick then and you'll probly barf
and my pre-...diction is that you gon probably fall
either somewhere in the lobby or the hallway wall
and every-... things spinnin your beginning to think women are swimmin in
pink linen again in the sink
then in a couple of minutes that bottle of guinness is finished
you are now allowed to officially slap bitches
you have the right to remain violent and start wildin
start a fight with the same guy that was smart eye'n ya
get in the car and start it and start drivin
over the island and cause a 42 car pile up
Earth calling, pilot to co-pilot, looking for life on this planet sir, no
sign of it
All i could see is a bunch of smoke flyin and I'm so high that I might die if
i go by it.
Let me out of this place I'm outta place, I'm in in outter space, I've just
vanished without a trace.
I'm going to a pretty place now where the flowers grow, I'll be back in an
hour or so.
Cuz every time I go to try to leave (whoa-o-o)
someone keeps pullin on my sleeve (whoa-o-o)
I dont wanna but I gotta stay (whoa-o-o)
these drugs really gotta hold on me (whoa-o-o)
Cuz everytime I try ta tell 'em no (no-o-o)
they won't let me ever let 'em go (go-o-o)
I'm a sucker all I gotta say (whoa-o-o)
is drug's really gotta hold on me
In third grade all I used to do, was sniff glue through a tube and play rubix
cube
Seventeen years later I'm as rude as jude (reference to rude jude who makes frequent apperances on jenny jones)
Schemein on the first chick with the hugest boobs
I got no game, and every face looks the same
they got no name, so i don't need game to play
I just say whatever I want, to whoever I want, whenever i want, wherever I
want, however I want
However I do show some respect to few
This ecstacy has got me standin next to you
Gettin sentimental as fuck, spillin guts to you
We just met, but I think I'm in love with you
But your on it too, so you tell me you love me too,
Wake up in the morning like ""What the fuck we do?""
I gotta go bitch, you know I got stuff to do, Cuz if I get caught cheatin
then I'm stuck with you
But in the long run these drugs are gonna catch up sooner or later
But fuck it I'm on one, so let's enjoy, let the ex destroy your spinal chord,
so it's not a straight line no more
So we walk around lookin like some wind-up dolls, shit stickin out of our
backs like a dinosaur,
Shit, six hit's won't even get me high no more, so bye for now, I'm gonna try
to find some more
Chorus
That's the sound of a bottle when it's hollow when you swallow it all
wallow and drown in your sorrow
And tomorrow your probably gonna wanna do it again
What's a little spinal fluid between you and a friend, screw it
and whats a little bit of alcohol poisoning? and whats a little fight,
tomorrow you'll be boys again
It's your life, live it however you wanna
Marajuana is everywhere, where was you brought up?
It don't matter as long as you get where you're goin
Cuz none of this shit's gonna mean shit where we're goin
They tell you to stop but you just sit there ignorin, even though you wake up
feelin like shit every mornin.
But your young, you got a lot of drugs to do, girls to screw, parties to
crash, sucks to be you
If I could take it all back now I wouldn't, I woulda did more shit that
people said that I shouldnt
But I'm all grown up now, and upgraded and graduated to better drugs and
updated
But I still gotta a lot of growin up to do, I still gotta whole lot of
throwin up to spew
But when it's all said and done i'll be forty before i know it wit a 40 on
the porch tellin stories
with a bottle of Jack, two grandkids on my lap, babysitting for Hailey, while
Hailey's out gettin shmashed.
Chorus x 2
drugs really gotta hold on me
really got a hold on me
drugs really gotta hold on me
they really got a hold on me"

Feet planted and stand with a grin full of chapped

Pen full of ink, think sinful and raps sick shit
Shrink, pencil me in for my last visit
Drink Gin 'til my chin's full of splashed whiskers
Hash Whiskey and ash 'til I slap bitches
Ask Bizzy, he's been here the past 6 years

Hehe, guess who Slim Shady just signed to Interscope
My little sisters birthday, she'll remember me
For a gift I had ten of my
boy's take her virginity
And bitches know me as a horny-ass freak
Her mother wasn't raped; I ate her pussy while she was
asleep
Pissy drunk throwing up in a urinal (You Fucking

That's why the city is filled with a bunch of fuckin'
idiots still
That's why the first motherfucker poppin' some shit,
he gets killed
That's why we don't call it ""Detroit"", we call it
""Amityville""
You can get capped after just having a cavity filled
That's why they're crowned the murder capital still
This ain't Detroit, this is motherfuckin' Hamburger
Hill
We don't do drive-bys; we park in front of houses and
shoot
And when the police come, we fuckin' shoot it out with
them too
That's the mentality here, that's the reality here
Did I just hear somebody say they wanna challenge me
here?
While I'm holdin' a pistol with this many calibers
here?
Try some registration, it just made the shit valid
this year?
'Cause once I snap, I can't be held accountable for my
actions
That's when accidents happen, when a thousand bullets
come at your house
And collapse the foundation around you when they found
you and your family in it
God damnit, admit it when he told you

on Slim's shit and start riots like Limp Bizkit (Limp Bizkit)
Throw on 'Guilty Conscience' at concerts
and watch mosh pits til motherfuckers knock each other unconcious

Some of these crowds me and Snoop draw +Is+ niggaz from Crenshaw

D-R-E and Shady, with Doggy from Long Beach
(East-syde!) Came a long way, to makin these songs play

I'm the Head Nigga In Charge, I'm watchin you move
You're found dead in your garage, with ten o'clock news coverage
Gotta love it, cause I expose the facade
Your little lungs is too small to hotbox with God
All jokes aside, come bounce with us
Standin over you with a twelve gauge, about to bust
It's like ashes to ashes and dust to dust
I might leave in the bodybag, but never in cuffs
So who do you trust? They just not rugged enough
When things get rough I'm in the club shootin with Puff
Bitch, please - you must have a mental disease
Assume the position and get back down on your knees - c'mon

pickets outside the Interscope offices every night
What if he's right? I'm just a criminal, makin a living
off of the world's misery - what in the world gives me the right
to say what I like, and walk around flippin the bird
Livin the urban life, like a white kid from the 'burbs
Dreamin at night of screamin at mom, schemin to leave
Run away from home and grow to be as evil as me
I just want you all to notice me and people to see
that somewhere deep down, there's a decent human being in me
It just can't be found, so the reason you've been seeing this me
is cause this is me now, the recent dude who's being this mean
So when you see me, dressin up like a nerd on Tv
or heard the Cd usin the fag word so freely
it's just me being me, here want me to tone it down?
{*Lower pitch*} Suck my fuckin dick, you faggot
You happy now? Look here
[Eminem - impersonating Snoop]
I start some trouble everywhere that I go (that I go)
Ask the bouncers in the club cause they know (cause they know)
I start some shit they throw me out the back do' (the back do')
Come back and shoot the club up with a fo'-fo' (a fo'-fo')

Yesterday I changed your diaper,
Wiped you and powdered you.
How did you get so big?
Can't believe it, now you're two
Baby, you're so precious,
Daddy's so proud of you
Sit down, bitch,
If you move again I'll beat the shit out of you

Don't make me wake this baby,
She doesn't need to see
What I'm about to do
Quit crying, bitch
Why do you always make me shout at you?
How could you?
Just leave me
And love him out the blue
[Kim cries]
Oh, what's'a matter kim?
Am I too loud for you??
[Kim screams]
Too bad, bitch,
You gonna finally hear me out this time
At first, I'm like all right,
You wanna throw me out?
That's fine!
But not for him to take my place,
Are you out you're mind?
This couch, this tv,
This whole house is mine.
How could you let him sleep in our bed?
Look at him,
Look at your husband now!
[Kim: No!]
I said look at him!
He ain't so hot now is he?
Little punk
[Kim: Why are you doing this?]
Shut the fuck up!

You really did a number on me
Never knew me cheatin' on you
Would come back to hunt me.

That was years ago,
I thought we wiped the slate clean
That's fucked up!

Oh, God, my brain is racin'!

What are you doing?
Change the station, I hate this song!
Does this look like a big joke?

Oh my god, I'm crackin up, get a grip, Marshall!
Hey, remember the time we went to Brian's party?
And you were, like, so drunk
that you threw up all over Archie?
That was funny, wasn't it?
[Kim: Yes!]
That was funny, wasn't it?
[Kim: Yes!]
See, it all makes sense, doesn't it?
You and your husband had a fight
One of you tries to grab a knife,
And during the struggle, he accidentally
Gets his Adam's apple sliced
And while this is goin' on
his son just woke up,
and he just walks in
She panics
And he gets his throat cut, so
Now they both dead
.And you slash your own throat,
so now it's double homicide and suicide
I should have known better
When you started to act weird,
We could've...
Hey! Where ya goin'?
Get back!
Here! You can't run from me, Kim!
It's just us, nobody else! You're only
Makin' this harder on yourself!
Ha, ha -- gotcha!

Go ahead yell
Here, I'll scream with ya!

Don't you get it bitch?
No one can hear you
Now shut the fuck up and get
What's comin to you
You were supposed to love me!

So you can suck my dick if you don't like,
my shit
Cause I was high when I wrote this so suck,
my dick
[Verse 1: Eminem]
Two pills I pop, 'til my pupils swell up like
two pennies
I'm Clint Eastwood in his mid-twenties
A young ass man with a trash can, strapped to the back
Of his ass so the rats can't chew through his
last pants
I'm like a mummy at night, fightin' with bright lightnin'
Frightened with five little white Vicodin
pills bitin' him
I'm like a fuckin' wasp in the hospital lost
Stingin' the fuck outta everything I come across in the halls
I light a candle and place it up on the mantle
Grab a knife at the blade and stab you with the fucking handle
So when you find yourself wrapped up in the blinds, hurting
(Bitch it's too late)
Cause once you're hung from the drapes,
it's curtains
[Swifty]
I'm an instigator, .380 slug penetrator
Degrading, creating murders to kill haters
Accused for every crime known through the equator
They knew I did it for having blood on my 'gators
My weed'll hit your chest like a
double barrel gauge and
I'm a black grenade that'll blow up in your face
With a fifth in me, when I guzzle Remi I do shit on purpose
You never hear me say forgive me
I'm snatchin every penny, it gotta be that way nigga, face it
That weed I sold to you, Brigade laced it
You hidin, I make the president get a facelift
Niggas just afraid, handin' me they bracelets
Chilling in the lab wasted
I'm the type that'll drink Kahlua and gin, throw up on the mic
Your life is ruined, you get socked right on site
And even at the Million Man March, we gon' fight

So you can suck my dick if you don't like,

Cause I was high when I wrote this so suck,

Cause I don't give a fuck if you don't like,

Cause I was high when I wrote this so suck,

Slashing your tires, flying down Fenkell and Meyers
Plates expired, soon as I'm hired, I'm fired
Jacking my dick off in a bed of barbed wire

Bitch didn't you read the flyer
Special invited guest will be, Richard Pryor
(Aren't you a male dancer)
Nah bitch, I'm retired
Fucking your bitch in the ass with a tire iron
I'm ripped, I'm on an acid trip
My Dj's in a coma for letting the record skip
I'm fucking anything when I'm snorting
It's gonna cost 300 dollars
to get my pitbull an abortion
Some bitch asked for my autograph
I called her a whore, spit beer in her face and laughed
I drop bombs like I was in Vietnam
All bitches is hoes, even my stinkin' ass mom
[Proof]
Ayo, flashback, two feets, too deep up in that ass crack
Weed laced with something, nigga pass that
In Amsterdam we only hang out with hash rats
At a Stop the Violence rally, I blast gats
Bmi on publishing, get your Ascap-ped
The Kuniva, divide up your cash stack
Run your motherfuckin' pockets, Asap

Born loser, half thief and half black
Bring your boys and your guns and get laughed at
Bitch smacker rich rappers get they Jag jacked
And found chopped up in a trash bag

We strangling rappers until the point they can't yell
Cause they crew is full of fags and sweeter than
bake sales
Reckless, come from behind and snatch your necklace
Gruesome, and causin more violence than nine hoodlums
I grapple your adam's apple until it crackle
Run right past you, turn around, grab you and stab you
Get executed, cause I'm a Luni, I got a Yukmouth
And it's polluted, I cock it back then shoot it
I love snatching up players thugs and young ballers
Shoot up the household, even the young toddlers
Brigade barricade to bring the noise
While the bullets break your bones up like Christmas toys
If I go solo, I'm doin a song with Bolo
A big Chinese nigga, screamin Kuniva, yo, yo...
I leave ya face leaking, run up in church
And smack the preacher while he's preaching,
take a swing at the deacon
[Kon Artis]
I used to tell cats I sold weed and weight
I was straight 'til I got caught selling em shape
I'm ignorant, with the intent to snatch your rent
I got kicked out of summer camp for having sex in my tent
With the superintendent's daughter, my brain's out of order
I've been a Kon Artis since I was swimmin in water
In cahoots with this nigga named Carlisle Von
Who got fired from Ups for tryin to send you a bomb
(Special delivery)
I signed to a local label for fun
Say I got cancer, get dropped, take the advancement and run
Drive-by you in the rain while you carry your son
Call your house and hang up on you for not giving me none
Born straight up out a pussy but a son of a gun
Got a reputation for havin niggas running they funds
Used to be the type of nigga that was folding some ones
'til I met your fat mama, now I'm rolling in dough
[Chorus]
[Final]
Ha ha.. suck my mothafuckin' dick
D-12.. Dirty-mothafuckin'-Dozen
Nasty like a stank slut bitch with thirty fuckin husbands
Bizarre Kid, Swifty Mcvay, the Kon Artis
The Kuniva, Dirty Harry and Slim Shady"
The Kids,The Marshall Mathers (Deluxe),2002,"(Teacher Sings) And everyone should get along..
Ok children quiet down, quiet down
Children i'd like to introduce your new substitute teacher for the day
His name is Mr. Shady
Children quite down please
Brian don't throw that.. (SHUT UP!)
Mr. Shady will be your new substitute while Mr. Kaniff is out with pnumonia
(HE'S GOT AIDS!) Good luck Mr. Shady...
(Verse 1-Eminem)
Hi there little boys and girls
(FUCK YOU!) Today we're going to learn how to poison squirrels
But first, i'd like you to meet my friend Bob (Huh?)
Say Hi Bob, (""Hi Bob"") Bob's 30 and still lives with his Mom
and he don't got a job Cause Bob sits at home and smokes pot
But his 12 year old brother looks up to him awful lot.
And Bob likes to hang out at the local waffle spot
and wait in the parking lot for waitresses off the clock
When it's late and the lot gets dark and fake like he walks his dog
He drag 'em in the woods and goes straight to the choppin block.
And even if they escape and got the cops
The ladies would be so afraid, they would drop the charge
Till one night Mrs. Stacey went off the job
When she felt someone grab her whole face and said not to talk
But Stacey knew it was Bob and said knock it off
But Bob wouldn't knock it off cause he's crazy and off his rocker.
Crazier than Slim Shady is off the locker
You couldn't even take him to Dre's to get Bob a doctor
He grabbed Stace by the leg, he chopped it off her
And dropped her off in the lake for the cops to find her
But ever since the day Stacey went off the wander
They never found her, and Bob still hangs at the waffle diner
And that's the story of Bob and his marijuana,
And what it might do to you
So see if the squirrels want it, cause it's bad for you
(Chorus) See children, drugs are bad
And ff you don't believe me, ask ya Dad
And If you don't believe him, ask ya Mom
She'll tell you how she does 'em all the time
So kids say no to drugs
So you don't act like everyone else does
And there's really nothing else to say
Drugs are just bad mmm k...
(Verse 2-Eminem)
My penis is the size of a peanut, Have you seen it?
Fuck no you ain't seen it, it's the size of a peanut (Huh?)
Speaking of peanuts, you know what else is bad for squirrels?
Extacy is the worst drug in the world
If someone offers it to you, don't do it
Kids, 2 hits'll probably drain all your spinal fluid
And spinal fluid is final, you won't get it back
So don't get attached, it'll attack every bone in ya back
Meet Zack, 21 years old
After hanging around with some friends at a Frat party he gets bold,
and decides to try five, when he's bribed by five guys
And peer pressure will win everytime you try to fight it
Suddenly, he starts to convulse
And his pulse goes into hyperdrive, and his eyes go back in his skull
His back starts ta look like the McDonald's Arches
He's on Donald's carpet, laying horizontal barfin'
And everyone in the apartment starts laughin' at him
""Hey Adam, Zack is a jackass, look at him""
So they took it to, so they think it's funny
So their laughin' at basically nothing
Except maybe wastin' their money
Meanwhile, Zack's in a coma, the action is over
And his back and his shoulders, hunched up like he was practicin' Yoga
And that's the story of Zack, the extacy maniac
So don't even feed that to squirrels class, cause it's bad for you
(Repeat chorus)
(Verse 3-Eminem) Last but not least,
One of the most humungous problems among young people today,
is fungus
It grows from cow manure,
They pick it out, wipe it off, bag it up,
and you put it right in ya mouth and chew it...Yum Yum
Then you start to see some dumb stuff
And everything slows down when you eat some, of ...'em...
And sometimes you see things that aren't there
(Like what?) Like fat woman in g-strings with orange hair
(Mr. Shady what's a g-string?)
It's worn, Claire! Women stick them up their behind, and go out and wear 'em
(Huh?)
And if you swallow too much of the magic mushroom
Whoops, did i say magic mushroom, i meant fungus
Ya tongue gets all swolled up like a cow's tongue
(How come?) Cause it comes from a cow's dump (Oh)
See drugs are bad, it's a common fact
But your Mom and Dad know that's all i'm good at
(Ert) But don't be me,
cause if ya grow up and ya go and OD
They're gonna come for me and I'ma have to grow a goatee
And get a disguise and hide, cause it'll be my fault
So don't do drugs, and do exactly as i don't,
cause I'm bad for you
(Repeat chorus)
(Teacher & Classmates) Come on children, clap along
(SHUT UP!) Sing along children (SUCK MY MOTHERFUCKING DICK!) Drugs are just bad,
drugs are just bad (SOUTH PARK IS GONNA SUE ME) So don't do drugs,
so there'll be more for me (GOD DAMNIT! MUSHROOMS KILLED KENNY)
(Pltttt OOOO *fart noises*) la la la la!"

A kid who refused to respect adults
Wore spectacles with taped frames and a freckled nose
A corny lookin white boy, scrawny and always ornery
Cause I was always sick of brawny bullies pickin on
me
And I might snap, one day just like that
I decided to strike back and flatten every tire on the
bike rack
(Whosssssh) My first day in junior high, this kid
said,
""It's you and I, three o'clock sharp this afternoon
you die""
I looked at my watch it was one twenty
""I already gave you my lunch money what more do you
want from me?!?""
He said, ""Don't try to run from me, you'll just make
it worse...""
My palms were sweaty, and I started to shake at first
Something told me, ""Try to fake a stomach ache it
works""
I screamed, ""Owww! My appendix feels like they could
burst!
Teacher, teacher, quick I need a naked nurse!""

Brain damage, ever since the day I was born
Drugs is what they used to say I was on
They say I never knew which way I was goin
But everywhere I go they keep playin my song
[Eminem]
Brain damage..
Way before my baby daughter Hailey
I was harassed daily by this fat kid named D'Angelo
Bailey
An eighth grader who acted obnoxious, cause his father
boxes
so everyday he'd shove me in the lockers
One day he came in the bathroom while I was pissin
And had me in the position to beat me into submission
He banged my head against the urinal til he broke my
nose,
Soaked my clothes in blood, grabbed me and choked my
throat
I tried to plead and tell him, ""We shouldn't beef""
But he just wouldn't leave, he kept chokin me and I
couldn't breathe
He looked at me and said, ""You gonna die honkey!""
The principal walked in (What's going on in here?)
and started helpin him stomp me
I made them think they beat me to death
Holdin my breath for like five minutes before they
finally left
Then I got up and ran to the janitor's storage booth
Kicked the door hinge loose and ripped out the four
inch screws
Grabbed some sharp objects, brooms, and foreign tools
""This is for every time you took my orange juice,
or stole my seat in the lunchroom and drank my
chocolate milk.
Every time you tipped my tray and it dropped and
spilt.
I'm gettin you back bully! Now once and for good.""
I cocked the broomstick back and swung hard as I
could
and beat him over the head with it til I broke the
wood
Knocked him down, stood on his chest with one foot..
.. Made it home, later that same day
Started reading a comic, and suddenly everything
became gray
I couldn't even see what I was tryin to read
I went deaf, and my left ear started to bleed
My mother started screamin, ""What are you on,
drugs?!?
Look at you, you're gettin blood all over my rug!""
(Sorry!)
She beat me over the head with the remote control
opened a hole, and my whole brain fell out of my
skull
I picked it up and screamed, ""Look bitch, what have
you done?!?""
[M] ""Oh my God, I'm sorry son""
[E] ""Shut up you cunt!"" I said, ""Fuck it!""
Took it and stuck it back up in my head
then I sewed it shut and put a couple of screws in my
neck
Chorus

It's brain damage..
I got brain damage..
It's brain damage..
It's probably brain damage..

If I Had,The Slim Shady,1999,"Life.. by Marshall Mathers
What is life?
Life is like a big obstacle
put in front of your optical to slow you down
And everytime you think you gotten past it
it's gonna come back around and tackle you to the damn ground
What are friends?
Friends are people that you think are your friends
But they really your enemies, with secret indentities
and disguises, to hide they true colors
So just when you think you close enough to be brothers
they wanna come back and cut your throat when you ain't lookin
What is money?
Money is what makes a man act funny
Money is the root of all evil
Money'll make them same friends come back around
swearing that they was always down
What is life?
I'm tired of life
I'm tired of backstabbing ass snakes with friendly grins
I'm tired of committing so many sins
Tired of always giving in when this bottle of Henny wins
Tired of never having any ends
Tired of having skinny friends hooked on crack and mini-thins
I'm tired of this DJ playing YOUR shit when he spins
Tired of not having a deal
Tired of having to deal with the bullshit without grabbing the steel
Tired of drowning in my sorrow
Tired of having to borrow a dollar for gas to start my Monte Carlo
I'm tired of motherfuckers spraying shit and dartin off
I'm tired of jobs startin off at five fifty an hour
then this boss wanders why I'm smartin off
I'm tired of being fired everytime I fart and cough
Tired of having to work as a gas station clerk
for this jerk breathing down my neck driving me bezerk
I'm tired of using plastic silverware
Tired of working in Building Square
Tired of not dating Alana
Tired of not being a millionaire
But if I had a million dollars
I'd buy a damn brewery, and turn the planet into alcoholics
If I had a magic wand, I'd make the world suck my dick
without a condom on, while I'm on the john
If I had a million bucks
it wouldn't be enough, because I'd still be out
robbing armored trucks
If I had one wish
I would ask for a big enough ass for the whole world to kiss
I'm tired of being white trash, broke and always poor
Tired of taking pop bottles back to the party store
I'm tired of not having a phone
Tired of not having a home to have one in if I did have it on
Tired of not driving a BM
Tired of not working at GM, tired of wanting to be him
Tired of not sleeping without a Tylenol PM
Tired of not performing in a packed coliseum
Tired of not being on tour
Tired of fucking the same blonde whore after work
in the back of a Contour
I'm tired of faking knots with a stack of ones
Having a lack of funds and resorting back to guns
Tired of being stared at
I'm tired of wearing the same damn Nike Air hat
Tired of stepping in clubs wearing the same pair of Lugz
Tired of people saying they're tired of hearing me rap about drugs
Tired of other rappers who ain't bringin half the skill as me
saying they wasn't feeling me on ""Nobody's As Ill As Me""
I'm tired of radio stations telling fibs
Tired of J-L-B saying ""Where Hip-Hop Lives""
But if I had a million dollars
I'd buy a damn brewery, and turn the planet into alcoholics
If I had a magic wand, I'd make the world suck my dick
without a condom on, while I'm on the john
If I had a million bucks
it wouldn't be enough, because I'd still be out
robbing armored trucks
If I had one wish
I would ask for a big enough ass for the whole world to kiss
You know what I'm saying?
I'm tired of all of this bullshit
Telling me to be positive
How'm I 'sposed to be positive when I don't see shit positive?
Know what I'm sayin?
I rap about shit around me, shit I see
Know what I'm sayin? Right now I'm tired of everything
Tired of all this player hating that's going on in my own city
Can't get no airplay, you know what I'm sayin?
But ey, it's cool though, you know what I'm sayin?
Just fed up
That's my word"

My favoite color is red, like the blood shed
from Kurt Cobain's head, when he shot himself dead
Women all grabbin at my shishkabob
Bought Lauryn Hill's tape so her kids could starve
(I can't stand white people!)
You thought I was livid, now I'm even more so
Shit I got full blown Aids and a sore throat
I got a wardrobe with an orange robe {*wolf whistle*}
I'm in the fourth row, signin autographs at your show
(Yo can you sign this right here?)
I just remembered that I'm absent minded
Wait, I mean I've lost my mind, I can't find it
I'm freestylin every verse that I spit
cause I don't even remember the words to my shit (umm, one two)
I told the doc I need a change in sickness
and gave a girl herpes in exchange for syphilis
Put my Lp on your Christmas gift list
You wanna get high, here bitch just sniff this
Cum on everybody -- get down tonight (8x)

Yo.. yo yo yo yo
I tried suicide once and I'll try it again
That's why I write songs where I die at the end

I go on stage in front of a sellout crowd
and yell out loud, ""All y'all get the hell out now""
Fuck rap, I'm givin it up y'all, I'm sorry

I'm bored out of my gourd -- so I took a hammer
and nailed my foot to the floorboard of my Ford
Guess I'm just a sick sick bastard
who's one sandwich short of a picnic basket (I ain't got it all)
One Excederin tablet short of a full medicine cabinet
I feel like my head has been shredded like lettuce and cabbage
(ohhhhhhh) And if you ever see a video for this shit
I'll probably be dressed up like a mummy with my wrists slit
Cum on everybody -- get down tonight (8x)

Got bitches on my jock out in East Detroit
Cause they think that I'm a motherfuckin Beastie Boy {*wolf whistle*}

They was like, ""Gee I don't know, he might be!""
I told em, ""Meet me at Kid Rock's next concert
I'll be standin by the Loch Ness Monster (okay) peace out (bye!!)""
Then I jetted to the weed house
Smoked out til I started bustin freestyles
Broke out then I dipped quick back to the crib, put on lipstick
Crushed up the Tylenol and ate it with a dipstick (*slurping*}
Made a couple of crank calls collect [*brrrrrrring, click*]
""Ken Kaniff from Connecticut, can you accept?""
I wanna make songs all the fellas dub
And murder every rich rapper that I'm jealous of
So just remember when I bomb your set
Yo, I only cuss to make your mom upset

Rock Bottom,The Slim Shady,1999,"Ah yeah, yo!
This song is dedicated to all the happy people
All the happy people who have real nice lives
And who have no idea whats it like to be broke as fuck
Verse One:
I feel like I'm walking a tight rope, without a circus net
I'm popping perkasets, I'm a nervous wreck
I deserve respect; but I work a sweat for this worthless check
Bout to burst this tech, at somebody to reverse this debt
Minimum wage got my adrenaline caged
Full of venom and rage
Especially when I'm engaged
And my daughter's down to her last diaper
That's got my ass hyper
I pray that god answers, maybe I'll ask nicer
Watching ballers while they flossing in their pathfinders
These overnight stars becoming autograph signers
We'll all gone blow up and leave the past behind us
Along with the small fry's and average half pinters
While playa haters turn bitch like they have vaginas
Cause we see them dollar signs and let the cash blind us
Money will brainwash you and leave your ass mindless
Snakes slither in the grass spineless
Chorus: repeat 2X
That's Rock Bottom
When this life makes you mad enough to kill
That's Rock Bottom
When you want something bad enough to steal
That's Rock Bottom
When you feel you have had it up to here
Cause you mad enough to scream but you sad enough to tear
Verse Two:
My life is full of empty promises
And broken dreams
I'm hoping things will look up
But there ain't no job openings
I feel discouraged hungry and malnourished
Living in this house with no furnace, unfurnished
And I'm sick of working dead end jobs with lame pay
And I'm tired of being hired and fired the same day
But fuck it, if you know the rules to the game play
Cause when we die we know were all going the same way
It's cool to be player, but it sucks to be the fan
When all you need is bucks to be the man
Plus a luxury sedan
Too comfortable and roomy in a six
They threw me in the mix
With all these gloomy lunatics
Walk around depressed
And smoke a pound of ses a day
And yesterday went by so quick it seems like it was just today
My daughter wants to throw the ball but I'm too stressed to play
Live half my life and throw the rest away
Chorus
There's people that love me and people that hate me
But it's the evil that made me this backstabbing, deceitful, and shady
I want the money, the women, the fortune, and the fame
That Means I'll end up burning in hell scorching in flames
That means I'm stealing your checkbook and forging your name
Lifetime bliss for eternal torture and pain
Right now I feel like just hit the rock bottom
I got problems now everybody on my blocks got 'em
I'm screaming like those two cops when 2pac shot 'em
Holding two glocks, I hope your doors got new locks on 'em
My daughter's feet ain't got no shoes or sock's on 'em
And them rings you wearing look like they got a few rocks on 'em
And while you flaunting them I could be taking them to shops to pawn them
I got a couple of rings and a brand new watch you want 'em?
Cause I never went gold of one song
I'm running up on someone's lawns with guns drawn
Chorus"
Soap,The Slim Shady,1999,"[Soppy romantic music plays in the background]
Roger : Skylar Montgomery?
Montgomery : What do you want from me Roger?
Roger : I know it was you all along messing around with my dear Veronica!
Montgomery : Wait a minute, you hold hold it right there. Me and that woman
love each other.
Roger : Love? What do you know of love?
Montgomery : We were destined to be together. I met her on the beach...!
Roger :Are you out to destroy me?
Montgomery : No Roger. That's not what I want to do.
Roger : I love her! And were going to be together."
As The World Turns,The Slim Shady,1999,"(Chorus 2X)
I don't know why this world keeps turning
Round and Round
But I wish it would stop, and let me off right now
Yes man
As the World Turns
We all experience things in life
Trials and Tribulations
That we all must go through
When someone wants to test us
When someone tries our patience
[Eminem]
I hang with a bunch of hippies
and wacky tobacco planters
Who swallow lit roaches
and light up like jack-o-lanterns
Outsiders baby, and we suing the courts
Cuz we're dope as fuck and only get a 2 in the source
They never should've booted me out of reform school
Deformed fool,takin a shit in a warm pool
They threw me out the Ramada Inn
I said it wasn't me, I got a twin
(Oh my god it's you! Not again!)
It all started when my mother took my bike away
Cuz I murdered my guinea pig and stuck him in the
microwave
After that, It was straight to the 40 ouncers
Slappin teachers, and jackin off in front of my
counselors
Class clown freshman, dressed like Les Nessman
Fuck the next lesson, I'll past the test guessin
And all the other kids said Eminem's a dishead,
He'll never last, the only class he'll pass is phys ed
May be true, till I told this bitch in gym class
That she was too fat to swim laps, she needed Slim
Fast (Who Me?)
Yeah bitch you so big you walked into big Tanny's and stepped on Jenny Craig
She picked me up to snap me like a skinny twig
Put me in the headlock, then I thought of my guinea pig
I felt the evilness and started transformin (RARRRR!)
It began storming, I heard a bunch of cheering fans swarming
Grabbed that bitch by her hair
Drug her across the ground
And took her up to the highest diving board and tossed her down
Sorry coach, its too late to tell me stop
While I drop this bitch face down and watch her belly flop
(Chorus)
As the World Turns
These are the days of our lives
These are the things that we must go through
Day by day
[Eminem]
We drive around in million dollar sports cars
While little kids hide this tape from their parents like bad report cards
Outsiders, and we suing the courts
Cuz we dope as fuck and only get a 2 in The Source
Hypercondriac, hanging out at the laundromat
Where all the raunchy fat white trashy blondes be at
Dressed like a sailor, standin by a pale of garbage
It's almost dark and I'm still tryna nail a trailor park bitch
I met a slut and said ""What up, it's nice to meet ya""
I'd like to treat ya to a Faygo and a slice of pizza
But I'm broke as fuck and I don't get paid till the first of next month
But if you care to join me, I was bout to roll this next blunt
But I aint got no weed, no phillies, or no papers
Plus I'm a rapist and a repeated prison escapist
So gimme all your money
And don't try nothin funny
Cuz you know your stinkin ass is too fat to try to
outrun me
I went to grab my gun
Thats when her ass put it on me
Wit an uppercut and hit me with a basket of laundry
I fell through the glass doors
Started causin a scene
Then slid across the floor and flew right into a
washin machine
Jumped up with a broken back
Thank god I was smokin crack all day
And doped up off coke and smack
All I wanted to do was rape the bitch and snatch her
purse
Now I wanna kill her
But so I gotta catch her first
Ran through Rally's parkin lot and took a shortcut
Saw the house she ran up in
And shot her fuckin porch up
Kicked the door down to murder this divorced slut
Looked around the room
Thats when I seen the bedroom door shut
I know you're in there bitch! I got my gun cocked!
You might as well come out now
She said ""Come in, its unlocked!""
I walked in and all I smelled was Liz Claiborne
And seen her spread across the bed naked watchin gay
porn
She said ""Come her big boy, lets get acquainted""
I turned around to run, twisted my ankle and sprained
it
She came at me at full speed, nothin could stop her
I shot her five times and every bullet bounced off
her
I started to beg ""No, please let go""
But she swallowed my fuckin leg whole like an egg
roll
With one leg left, now I'm hoppin around crippled
I grabbed my pocket knife and sliced off her right
nipple
Just trying to buy me some time, then I remembered
this magic trick
Den Den Den Den Den Den, Go go gadget dick!
Whipped that shit out, and aint no doubt about it
It hit the ground and caused an earthquake and power
outage
I shouted ""Now bitch, lets see who gets the best!""
Stuffed that shit in crooked and fucked that fat slut
to death (Ahh!! Ahhh!)
Come here bitch!
Come here!
Take this motherfuckin dick!
Bitch, come here!
Chorus to fade
And as we go along
Throughout the days of our lives
We all face small obstacles and challenges everyday
That we must go through
These are the things that surround us through our
atmosphere
Every day
Every single day the world keeps turning
Keeps turning"
I'm Shady,The Slim Shady,1999,"Who came through with two glocks to terrorize your borough (Huh?)
Told you how to slap dips and murder your girl (I did)
Gave you all the finger and told you to sit and twirl
Sold a billion tapes and still screamed fuck the world
(Slim Shady), so come and kill me while my name's hot
And shoot me twenty five times in the same spot (Ow)
Think I've got a generation brainwashed
To pop pills and smoke pot till they brains rot (Uh, oh?)
Stop they blood flow until they veins clot
I need a pain shot, and a shot of plain scotch
Purple haze and acid raindrops
Spike the punch at the party and drain pop (gulp gulp)
Shaved my armpits and wore a tank top
Bad Boy, I told you that I can't stop
Gotta make 'em fear you before you make 'em feel you
So everybody buy my shit or I’ma come and kill you
I got mushrooms, I got acid, I got tabs and aspirin tablets
I'm your brother when you need some new weed to set you free
You know me I'm your friend when you need a mintin’
(Slim Shady)
I'm Shady
I like happy things, I'm really calm and peaceful (Uh huh huh)
I like birds, bees, I like people
I like funny things that make me happy and gleeful
Like when my teacher sucked my wee-wee in preschool (Woo!)
The ill type, I stab myself with a steel spike
While I blow my brain out just to see what it feels like
And this is how I am in real life
I don't want to just die a normal death, I wanna be killed twice (Uh huh)
How you wanna scare somebody with a gun threat
When they're high off of drugs they haven't even done yet
So bring the money by tonight
Cause your wife says this is the biggest knife
She ever saw in her life (Help me help me)
I try to keep it positive and play it cool
Shoot up the playground and tell the kids to stay in school (Stay in school!)
Cause I'm the one they can relate to and look up to better
Tonight I think I'll write my biggest fan a fuck you letter
I got mushrooms, I got acid, I got tabs and aspirin tablets
I'm your brother when you need some new weed to set you free
You know me I'm your friend when you need a mintin’
(Slim Shady)
I'm Shady
I listen to your demo tape and act like I don't like it (Aw that shit is wack)
Six months later you hear your lyrics on my shit (What????)
People don't buy shit no more they just dub it
That's why I'm still broke and had the number one club hit (Yup, uh huh)
But they love it when you make your business public
So fuck it, I've got herpes while we're on the subject (Uh huh)
And if I told you I had AIDS y'all would play it
Cause you stupid motherfuckers think I'm playing when I say it
Well, I do take pills, don't do speed
Don't do crack, don't do coke, I do smoke weed
Don't do smack, I do do shrooms
Do drink beer, I just wanna make a few things clear
My baby mama's not dead (nuh uh), she's still alive and bitching (yup)
And I don't have herpes, my dick's just itching
It's not syphilis, and as for being AIDS infested
I don't know yet, I'm too scared to get tested
I got mushrooms, I got acid, I got tabs and aspirin tablets
I'm your brother when you need some new weed to set you free
You know me I'm your friend when you need a mintin’
(Slim Shady)
I'm Shady
I told you I was Shady
Y'all didn't wanna believe me
I'm Shady
And that's my name

Bad Meets Evil ,The Slim Shady,1999,"[intro]
[Cowboy]
I reckon you ain't familiar with these here parts
You know, there's a story behind that there saloon
Twenty years ago, two outlaws
took this whole town over
Sheriffs couldn't stop em
Quickest damn gun slingers I've ever seen
Got murdered in cold blood
That ol' saloon there was their lil' home away from
home
They say the ghosts of Bad and Evil still live in that
tavern
And on a quiet night
You can still hear the footsteps of Slim Shady and
Royce Da Five-Nine
[Eminem]
I don't speak, I float in the air wrapped in a sheet
I'm not a real person, I'm a ghost trapped in a beat
I translate when my voice is read through a
sismograph
And a noise is bred, picked up and transmitted through
Royce's head (Aahhh)
Trapped him in his room, possessed him and hoist his
bed
Till the evilness flows through his blood like
poisonous lead
Told him each one of his boys is dead
I asked him to come to the dark side, he made a choice
and said
[Royce]
Who hard? yo I done heard worse
We can get in two cars and accelerate at each other
To see which one'll swerve first
Two blind bandits panic, whose mental capacity holds
That of a globe on top of nine other planets
Kissed the cheek of the devil
Intelligence level is hell-ier than treble peakin on
speakers in the ghetto
Dismissal, I'm not a fair man, disgraced the race of
an atheist
Intercepting missles wit my bare hands like a patriot
One track sliced without swords, I buried the Christ
corpse
In my past life when the Black Knight mounted the
white horse
And stay over-worked, its like the Nazis in the
nations
Collaborating, attemptin to take over the earth
[Eminem]
Cuz this is what happens when Bad Meets Evil
We hit the trees till we look like Vietnamese people
He's Evil, and I'm Bad like Steve Segal
Above the Law cuz I don't agree wit police either
(shit, me neither)
We ain't eager to be legal
So please leave me wit the keys to your Jeep Eagle
I breathe ether in three amounts
When I stab myself in the knee with a diseased needle
Releasin rage on anybody in squeezing range
Cold enough to make the seasons change into freezing rain
(He's insane) No I'm not, I just want to shoot up and I'm pissed off
Cuz I can't find a decent vein
[Royce]
The disaster wit dreds
I'm Bad enough to commit suicide and survive long
enough
To kill my soul after I'm dead
When in danger it's funny actually my flavor's similar
to a waiter
Cuz I serve any stranger wit money
I spray a hundred, man until they joint chains
While slippin bullets at point blank range like they
was punches
Piss on a flag and burn it, murder you
then come to your funeral
Serve this lobbyist, strangle your body then confirm you
Whippin human ass, throwin blows crackin jaws
Wit my fists wrapped in gause, dipped in glue and
glass
I'm blazin Mc's, at the same time amazin Mc's
Somehow Mc's ain't that eye-brow raisin to me
From all of angles of us, flash a mack loud enough to
cast a avalanche
And bust till volcanoes errupt
[interlude]
*phone rings*
Hello? (Billy) Aiyyo what's up (we're comin to get
you)
Stop, They Know It'S Us!!
[Eminem]
I used to be a loudmouth, remember me? (uh-ah)
I'm the one who burned your house down (oh)
Well I'm out now (shit), and this time I'm comin back
to blow your house up
And I ain't gon leave you a window to jump out of
Give me two fat tabs and three shrooms
And you won't see me like fat people in steam rooms
And when I go to hell and I'm gettin ready to leave
I'ma put air in a bag and charge people to breathe
[Royce] (Eminem)
Cuz this is what happens when Bad Meets Evil
And we hit the trees till we look like Vietnamese
people
He's Evil, and I'm Bad like Steve Segal
Against peaceful, see you in hell for the sequel
(We'll be waitin) See you in hell
Wall Street, Royce Da Five-Nine, Slim Shady
See you in hell for the sequel (bye bye)
Bad Meets Evil, what? (till next time)
[Cowboy]
And so that's the story when Bad Meets Evil
Two of the most wanted individuals in the county
Made Jesse James and Billy the Kid look like
law-abiding citizens
It's too bad they had to go out the way they did
Got shot in the back comin out of that ol' saloon
But their spirits still live on till this day
Shhh...[spits] wait, did y'all hear that?
[Footsteps and windblowing]"
Still Don't Give A Fuck,The Slim Shady,1999,"A lot of people ask me
Am I afraid of death?
Hell yeah I'm afraid of death,
I don't wanna die yet.
A lot of people think that I worship the devil,
That I do all types of retarded shit.
Look, I can't change the way I think,
I can't change the way I am,
But if I affended you, good
'cause I still don't give a fuck
I'm zonin' offa one joint
Stoppin' the limo
Hop in the window
Shoppin' the demo at gun point.
A lyricist without a clue
What year is this?
Fuck a needle, heres a sword
Body pierce with this.
Livin' them up
Never givin' a fuck
Gimme the keys I'm drunk
And I've never drivin' the truck.
But I smoke dope in the cab
I'll stab you with the sharpest knife I can grab
Come back the next week and re-open the scab.
A killer instinct runs in the blood
Empty your four clips and bury your guns in the mud.
I've calmed down now
I was heavy once into drugs
I could walk around straight for two months with a buzz.
My brain's gone
So worn my spirit is torn
The rest of my body is still being operated on
I'm duckin' the fuck down while I'm writin' this rhyme
'cause I'm probably gonna get struck by lightning this time.
To all the weed that I've smoked,
Yo this blunt's for you.
To all the people I've affended,
Yeah fuck you too.
To all the friends I use to have,
I miss my past
But the rest of you assholes can kiss my ass.
For all the drugs that I've done,
Yo I'm still gonna do.
To all the people I've affended,
Ya fuck you too.
Every time I reminist,
Yo I miss my past.
But I still don't give a fuck,
Ya'll can kiss my ass!
I walked into a gunfight with a knife to kill you
Cut you so fast
When your blood spilled it was still blue
I'll hang you 'til you dangle
And chain you at both ankles
And pull you apart from both angles
I wanna crush your skull
'til your brains leak out of your veins
And bust open like broken water mains.
So tell sadam not to bother
with making another bomb
'cause I'm crushing the whole world in my palm
I got your girl in my arm
And I'm armed with a fire arm
So big my entire arm's a giant fire bomb
Buy your mom a shirt with a slim shady iron-on
And the pants that match
Here mama try 'em on
I get amastertive
With a mouth full of adjectives
A brain full of adverbs
And a box full of laxitives
Proff of all school accidents
God help me
Before I commit some irresponsible acts again
To all the weed that I've smoked,
Yo this blunt's for you.
To all the people I've affended,
Yeah fuck you too.
To all the friends I use to have,
I miss my past
But the rest of you assholes can kiss my ass.
For all the drugs that I've done,
Yo I'm still gonna do.
To all the people I've affended,
Ya fuck you too.
Every time I reminist,
Yo I miss my past.
But I still don't give a fuck,
Ya'll can kiss my ass!
I wanted an album so rugged nobody could touch it
I spent a million a track
And went over my budget
Now how in the fuck am I supposed to get out of debt
I can't rap anymore I just murdered the alphabet
Drug sickness got me doin' some bug twitches
I'm withdrawling from crack so bad my blood itches
I don't rap to get the women
Fuck bitches
Gimme a fat slut that cooks and does dishes
Never ran with a clique I'm a posse
Kamikaze
Strappin' the mother fuckin' bomb accross me
From the second I was born My mama lost me
I'm a cross between manson-each ominozzi
I don't even know why the fuck I'm here in the first place.
The worst day on this earth was my first birthday.
Retarded
What did that nurse say?
Brain damage
Fuck I was born during an earthquake
To all the weed that I've smoked,
Yo this blunt's for you.
To all the people I've affended,
Yeah fuck you too.
To all the friends I use to have,
I miss my past
But the rest of you assholes can kiss my ass.
For all the drugs that I've done,
Yo I'm still gonna do.
To all the people I've affended,
Ya fuck you too.
Every time I reminist,
Yo I miss my past.
But I still don't give a fuck,
Ya'll can kiss my ass!"
Intro (Slim Shady),Slim Shady EP,1997,"May I have your attention please
May I have your attention please
Will the Real Slim Shady please stand up?
I repeat, will the Real Slim Shady please stand up?
We're gonna have a problem here...
{verse 1}
Ya'll act like you never seen a white person before
Jaws all on the floor like Pam like Tommy just burst in the door
Started whoopin her ass worst than before
they first were dirvorced sold her old furniture (scream)
It's the return of the
""Awww wait, no way, your kidding
He didn't just say what I think he did, did he?""
And Dr Dre said...
Nothing you idiots Dr Dre's dead he's locked in my basement (haha)
Feminist women loved Eminem
Chicka chicka chicka Slim Shady I'm sick of him
Look at him walking around grabing his you-know-what
Flippin' the you-know-who (yea but hes so cute though)
Yeah I probably got a couple of screws up in my head loose
But no worse than whats going on in your parents bedrooms
Sometimes I wanna get on TV and let Loose,
but can't, but it's cool for Tom Green to hump a dead moose
""My bum is on your lips my bum is on your lips
And if im lucky u might just give it a little kiss""
And that's the messege we deliver to little kids
and expect them not to know what a women's *vagina* is
Of course they're gonna know what intercourse is
by the time they hit 4th grade,
they got the discovery channel don't they?
We ain't nothing but mammals, well some of us cannibals
who *rip* other people open like canolopes
But if we can hump dead animals and antelopes
then theres no reason that a man and another man can't elope (ughh)
But if you feel like I feel I got the antadoite
Women wave your pantyhose, sing the chorus
And it gooooesss
(Refrain)
I'm Slim Shady
Yes I'm the Real Shady
All you other Slim Shadys are just imitating
So won't the real Slim Shady...
Please stand up, Please stand up, Please stand up
Cause I'm Slim Shady
Yes I'm the Real Shady
All you other Slim Shadys are just imitating
So won't the real Slim Shady...
Please stand up, Please stand up, Please stand up
{verse 2}
Will Smith don't gotta cuss in his raps to sell records
Well I do, so *f---* him and *f---* you too
You think I give a damn about a grammy?
Half of you critics can't even stomach me, let alone stand me
(but Slim what if u win wouldn't it be weird?)
Why? So you guys can just lie to get me here?
So you can sit me here next to Britney Spears
s--- Christina Aguilera better switch me chairs
So I can sit next to Carson Daily and Fred Durst
And hear them argue over who she gave *head* to first
Little *bitch* put me on blast on MTV
(yea hes cute but I think he's married to Kim, hehe)
I should download a audio on mp3
And show the whole world how you gave Eminem *head* (scream)
I'm sick of you little golden boy groups all you do is annoy me
So I been sent in here to destroy you
And there's a million of us just like me
Who cuss like me
Who just don't give a *f---* like me
Who dress like me
Walk, Talk and act like me
It just might be the next best thing
But not quite me
(Refrain)
{verse 3}
I'm like a headtrip to listen to
Cause I'm only giving you
things you joke about with your friends inside your living room
The only difference is I got the balls to say it In front of ya'll
And I don't got to be false or sugar coat it at all
I just get on the mic and spit it
Wheather you like to admit it
I'm better than 90% of you rappers out there
Then you wanna outkin kids like these albums like
Its funny cuz the rate im going when I'm 30
I'll be the only person in the nursing home flirting
Pinching nurses asses when I'm *hard* jerkin I'm jerking
But this whole bag of viagra isn't working
And every single person is a Slim Shady lurkin
He could be workin at Burger King spitten on your onion rings
Were in the parking lot circling
screaming I don't give a *f---*
With his windows down and system up
So will the Real Shady, please stand up
and put one of those fingers on each hand up
and to be proud to out of your mind and out of control
and one more time, loud as you can, how does it go?
Ha ha
Guess there's a Slim Shady in all of us
Fuck it, let's all stand up"
"Low, Down, Dirty",Slim Shady EP,1997,"Warning, this shit's gon be rated R, restricted
You see this bullet hole in my neck? It's self inflicted
Doctor slapped my momma, ""Bitch you got a sick kid""
Arrested, molested myself and got convicted
Wearing visors, sunglasses and disguises
Cause my split personality is having an identity crisis
I'm Dr. Hyde and Mr. Jekyll, disrespectful
Hearing voices in my head while these whispers echo
""Murder Murder Redrum""
Brain size of a bread crumb
Which drug will I end up dead from
Inebriated, till my stress is eleviated
""How in the fuck can Eminem and shady be related?""
Illiterate, illigitimate shit spitter
Bitch getter, hid in the bush like Margot Kidder
Jumped out (Ahhhh!) killed the bitch and did her
Use to let the babysitter suck my dick when I was little'er
Smoke a blunt while I'm titty fuckin Bette Midler
Sniper, waiting on your roof like the Fiddler
Y'all thought I was gonna rhyme with Riddler
Didn't Ya? Bring your bitch I wanna see if this dick gon' fit in her
Chorus: Eminem + (Redman Sample) - 2X
[E] I'm low down and I'm shiftee!
""And if you hear a man that sounds like me smack him
and ask him where the fuck did he get his damn raps from..""
I lace tunes, I'm out this world like Space Moons
With a bunch crazed loons dismissin brains like braze wounds
Nothing but idiots and misfits, dipshits
Doing whippits, passed out like Sanford snippits
Where's the weed, I wanna tamper with it
I'ma let your grandpa hit it
Mix it up with cocaine so her can't forget it
Fuck it, maybe I'm a bum
But I was put on this earth to make your baby mama cum
So what I'm on is way beyond the bomb or any alcoholic beverage
Losing all of my leverage
Went up inside the First National Bank broke, and left rich
Walking bio-hazard causing wreckage
Smoked out like Eckridge
Band just making my neck itch
What the fuck? Gimme the tech bitch
You just lost your tip, there's a pubic hair in my breakfast
Got shit popping off like bottle cap tips
Get your cap peeled like the dead skin of your mama's chapped lips
Slap hips, support domestic violence
Beat your bitches ass while your kids stare in silence
I'm just joking, is Dirty Dozen's really dust smoking?
If all your shit's missing, than probably one of us broke in
Chorus
My head's ringing, like it was Spider Sense tingling
Lit it like Green Bay did when they shitted on New England
I'm out the game, put the second string in
This Brandy got my swinging
Bobbing back and forth like a penguin
Delinquent, toking microphones with Broken English
Make your mama be like ""Ohh! This is good! Who sing this?""
""Slim Shady, his tape is dope, I love it
It's rugged, but he needs to quit talking all that drug shit.""
It was predicted by a medic
I'd grow to be an addicted diabetic
Living off liquid Triametic
Pathetic, but I don't think this headache's ever vanishing
Panicing, I think I might have just took too much Anasin
Frozen Manaquin, posted stiffer than a statue
I think I'm dying, God is that you?
Somebody help me, before I OD on an LP
Take me to ER ASAP for and IV
Motherfuck JLB, they don't support no hip hop
They say that's where it ends, the closest they gon come is Tupac
It's politics, it's all a fix
Setup by these white blue collared hicks
Just to make a dollar off of black music
With a subliminal ball of tricks
But those can kiss ass and swallow dicks
Chorus"
Just the Two of Us(Radio Edit),Slim Shady EP,1997,"Just the two of us.. (8X)
[Eminem]
Baby your da-da loves you (hey)
And I'ma always be here for you (hey) no matter what happens
You're all I got in this world
I would never give you up for nothin
Nobody in this world is ever gonna keep you from me
I love you
C'mon Hai-Hai, we goin to the beach
Grab a couple of toys and let da-da strap you in the car seat
Oh where's mama? She's takin a little nap in the trunk
Oh that smell (whew!) da-da musta runned over a skunk
Now I know what you're thinkin - it's kind of late to go swimmin
But you know your mama, she's one of those type of women
that do crazy things, and if she don't get her way, she'll throw a fit
Don't play with da-da's toy knife, honey, let go of it (no!)
And don't look so upset, why you actin bashful?
Don't you wanna help da-da build a sand castle? (yeah!)

And da-da's probably on his way to all of em except one
Cause mama's got a new husband and a stepson
And you don't want a brother do ya? (Nah)
Maybe when you're old enough to understand a little better
I'll explain it to ya
But for now we'll just say mama was real real bad
She was bein mean to dad and made him real real mad
But I still feel sad that I put her on time-out
Sit back in your chair honey, quit tryin to climb out (WAHH!)
I told you it's okay HaiHai, wanna ba-ba?

Baby, don't cry honey, don't get the wrong idea
Mama's too sweepy to hear you screamin in her ear (ma-maa!)
That's why you can't get her to wake, but don't worry
Da-da made a nice bed for mommy at the bottom of the lake
Here, you wanna help da-da tie a rope around this rock? (yeah!)
We'll tie it to her footsie then we'll roll her off the dock
Ready now, here we go, on the count of free..
One.. two.. free.. WHEEEEEE! (whoooooshhhhh)
There goes mama, spwashin in the wa-ta
No more fightin wit dad, no more restraining order
No more step-da-da, no more new brother
Blow her kisses bye-bye, tell mama you love her (mommy!)
Now we'll go play in the sand, build a castle and junk
But first, just help dad with two more things out the trunk
Just the two of us.. (2X)
And when we ride!

Murder Murder (Remix) *,Slim Shady EP,1997,"* the original appears on Eminem's ""Slim Shady EP"" on Web Entertainment
Chorus: Eminem (repeat 4X)
It's murder she wrote (it's murder she wrote)
It wasn't nuttin for her to be smoked (for her to be smoked)
[Eminem]
Left the keys in the van, with a gat in each hand
Went up in Eastland and shot a policeman
Fuck a peace plan, if a citizen bystands
the shit is in my hands, here's yo' lifespan
And for what yo' life's worth, this money is twice than
Grab a couple grand and lamp in Iceland
See I'm a nice man but money turned me to Satan
I'm thirsty for this green so bad I'm dehydratin
Hurry up with the cash bitch, I got a ride waitin
Shot a man twice in the back when he tried skatin
I want the whole pie, I won't be denied nathan
Maybe I need my head inside straightened
Brain contemplatin, clean out the register
Dip before somebody catches ya
or gets your description and sketches ya
The connection was the prime suspect
But I ain't set to flee the scene of the crime just yet
Cause I got a daughter to feed
And $200 ain't enough to water the seed
The best thing would be for me to leave Taco Bell and hit up Chess King
And have the lady at the desk bring
money from the safe in the back, stepped in wavin the Mac
Cooperate, and we can operate, and save an attack
This bitch tried escapin the jack
Grabbed her by the throat, it's murder she wrote
You barely heard a word as she choked
It wasn't nuttin for her to be smoked
But I slammed her on her back til her vertebrae broke
Just then the pigs bust in yellin ""Freeze""
But I'm already wanted for sellin ki's
And bunch of other felonies from A to Z like spellin bees
So before I dropped to the ground and fell on knees
I bust shots, they bust back
Hit be square in the chest, wasn't wearin a vest
Left the house, pullin out the drive backin out
Blew the back end out this lady's Jag, started blackin out
Pulled the Mac-10 out, stuck it in her face
Shut your yackin mouth, 'fore I blow the brain from out the back ya scalp
Drug her by her hair, smacked her up
Thinkin fuck it, mug her while you're there, jacked her up
Stole her car, made a profit
Grabbed the tape from out the deck and offed it out the window
Like the girl in ""Set It Off"" did
Jetted off kid, stole the whip, now I'm a criminal
Drove it through somebody's yard, dove into they swimmin pool
Climbed out and collapsed on the patio
I made it out alive but I'm injured badly though
Parents screamin: ""Son, go in and call the police
Tell em there's a crazy man disturbing all of the peace!""
Tried to stall him at least long enough to let me leap up
Run in they crib and at least leave with some little cheap stuff
Actin like they never seen nobody hit a ;ick before
Smashed the window, grabbed the Nintendo 64
When they sell out in stores the price triples
I ran up the block jumpin kids on tricycles
and collided with an 80-year old lady with groceries
There goes cheese, eggs, milk and Post Toasties
Stood up and started to see stars
Too many siren sounds, it seemed like a thousand police cars
Barely escaped, must-a been some dumb luck
Jumped up and climbed the back of a movin dump truck
But I think somebody seen me maybe
Plus I lost the damn Nintendo and I musta dropped the Beanie Baby
Fuck it I give up, I'm surrounded in blue suits
Came out with a white flag hollerin ""TRUCE TRUCE""
and surrendered my weapon to cops
Wasn't me! It was the gangster rap and the peppermint Schnapps
Chorus"
Tonight,Infinite,1996,"Women Singing:
Tonight, Tonight, Tonight, Tonight, Tonight
Verse 1:
I'm getting mad love, I'm snuggling hugs
Druggling thugs, smuggling drugs, juggling jobs, guzzling jugs
So here's a toast to federal checks
Hetero sex, unaffordable medical debts, huh
We travel in packs and ravel in facts and gravel in cracks
To find babbling Max, gaffling tracks
I grapple an axe for them baffling acts
The mysterious stab in the backs who dabble in wax
Still in my yard when I sculpted the culprit
The tall shit that will end up with his skull split
Then I buried the hatchet, I carried on my back
Butterfingers is here and it's necessary to scratch it
Baby all I wanna do is swallow one and two
Smoke a little bit and follow one of you
Back home when the party ends
So tonight I'm dropping naughty hints
To the finest women in the audience
Chorus:
Women Singing:
Tonight, Tonight, Tonight, Tonight, Tonight (blends in with lyrics)
Eminem: Cause we came here to do this tonight
We don't wanna fight, we don't want no one feeling uptight
Cause we came here to do this tonight
Till the morning light hope that everyone's feeling alright
Cause we came here to do this tonight
We don't wanna fight, we don't want no one feeling uptight
Cause we came here to do this tonight
Till the morning light hope that everyone's feeling alright
Verse 2:
Ayo, biters are like tarantulas, vandealous
Living as scandalous as a television evangelist
But I can handle this, I'm the rhyme biter crime fighter
Caped crusader, taking care of undeserving lime lighters
I think a living never meant for me
Experimentally I found a way to spread interamentally
When I stumbled upon this resolution
By using a special fusion of chemical solution for this resolution
You couldn't see me with binoculars
I armed like an octopus
Step on stage and you get socked and pushed
Talking that junk like you went black, guarded your back
Come battle me and you get smacked as hard as you act
When I rap I represent it and will never referee in it
Every minute so when I win it you never resent it
I'm forever demented, come up with funk, I'll never be scented
You got the point when I cleverly said it
Chorus:
Women Singing:
Tonight, Tonight, Tonight, Tonight, Tonight (blends in with lyrics)
Eminem: Cause we came here to do this tonight
We don't wanna fight, we don't want no one feeling uptight
Cause we came here to do this tonight
Till the morning light hope that everyone's feeling alright
Cause we came here to do this tonight
We don't wanna fight, we don't want no one feeling uptight
Cause we came here to do this tonight
Till the morning light hope that everyone's feeling alright
Verse 3:
Eminem is heading skyward
For those who thought that I would make you bored and treat you like a piece
of plywood
I've got miracle lyrical capability all in me
With the agility to escape a killer bee colony
So get your cameras and capture how miraculous
I rap for all you Draculas and showed you all how whack you was
I meant it as a dis, cause you don't posses the pizzazz as this
I'm hazardous enough already as it is
Without you adding fuel to the fire
I'm cruel to the liar
Who fails to recognize my reign of hell, rule to the sire
Clinical studies show that I'm cynical
There's no one who's identical to my fresh and authentic flow
I'm sure the party people can agree
That I'm enchanting, with the romantic
Freaking the vocals so frantically
So throw your hands up in the atmosphere
And let them know the only party that was phat was here, just be like
Chorus:
Women Singing:
Tonight, Tonight, Tonight, Tonight, Tonight (blends in with lyrics)

We don't wanna fight, we don't want no one feeling uptight

Infinite,Infinite,1996,"Oh yeah, this is Eminem baby, back up in that motherfucking ass
One time for your mother fucking mind, we represent the 313
You know what I'm saying?, cause they don't know shit about this
For the 9-6
Verse 1:
Ayo, my pen and paper cause a chain reaction
To get your brain relaxin, cause they be actin maniac in action
A brainiac in fact son, you mainly lack attraction
You looking zany whack with just a fraction of my tracks spun
My rhyming skills got you climbing hills
I travel through your mind until you spine like siren drills
I'm sliming grills of roaches, with sprayed on disinfectants
With some ex rappers till their spinal column disconnects
We disinfect then check the monologue, turn your system up
Twist them up, and indulge in the marijuana smoke
This is the season for noise pollution contamination
Examination of more cartoons than animation
My lamination of narration
Hit's a snare and bass of track fucked up rapper interrogation
When I declare invasion, there ain't no time to be stare and gazing
I turn the stage into a barren wasteland...
I'm Infinite
Chorus:
You heard of hell well I was sent from it
I went to it's surface and sentenced for murdering instruments
Now I'm trying to repent from it
But when I hear the beat I'm tempted to make another attempt at it...
I'm Infinite
Verse 2:
Bust it, I let the beat commence so I can beat the sense of your elite defense
I got to meet the fence fruit was stompin at your feet to rinse
I greet intensive ladies, I spoil all your fans
I foil plans and leave fluids leaking like oil bands
My coil hands around this microphone lethal
One thought in my cerebral is deeper then a Jeep full of people
MC's are feeble, I came to cause some pandemonium
Battle a band of phony MC's and stand the only one
Imitator, Intimidator, Stimulator, Simulator of data, Eliminator
There's never been a greater since the burial of Jesus
Fuck around and catch all of the venereal diseases
My thesis will smash a stereo to pieces
My accapella releases plastic masterpieces through telekinesis
And eases you mentally, gently, sentimentally, instrumentally
With entity, dementedly meant to be Infinite
Chorus:
You heard of hell well I was sent from it
I went to it's surface and sentenced for murdering instruments
Now I'm trying to repent from it
But when I hear the beat I'm tempted to make another attempt at it...
I'm Infinite
Verse 3:
Man I got evidence I'm never dense and I been clever ever since
My residence was hesitant to do some shit that represents the M-O
So I'm assuming all responsibility
Cause there's a monster will in me that always wants to kill MC's
Mic messaler, slamming like a wrestler
Here to make a mess of a lyric smuggling embezzler
No one is speacialer, My skill is intergalactical
I get cynical at a fool then I send a crew back to school
I never packed a tool or acted cool, it wasn't practical
I'd rather led a tactful, tractical, track for your fancy
In fact I can't see, or can't imagine
A man who ain't a lover of beats or a fan of scratching
This is for my family, the kid who had a cameo on my last jam
Plus the man who never had a plan B
Be all you can be, cause once you make an instant hit
I'm tense to be tempted when I see the sins my friends commit...
I'm Infinite
Chorus:
You heard of hell well I was sent from it
I went to it's surface and sentenced for murdering instruments
Now I'm trying to repent from it

Chorus: It's a broke day but everything is ok (It's ok)
I'm up all night, but everything is alright (It's alright)
It's a rough week, and I don't get enough sleep (I can't sleep)
It's a long year pretending I belong here (Belong here)
It's a broke day but everything is ok (It's ok)

Verse 1: Eminem
One day I plan to be a family man happily married
I wanna grow to be so old that I have to be carried
Till I'm glad to be buried
And leave this crazy world
And have at least a half a million for my baby girl
It may be early to be planning this stuff
Cause I'm still struggling hard to be the man, and it's tough
Cause man it's been rough, but still I manage enough
I've been taken advantage of, damaged and scuffed
My hands have been cuffed
But I don't panic and huff, frantic and puff
Or plan to give up, the minute shit hits the fan it erupts
I'm anteing up double or nothing, I've been trouble enough
And I'm sick of struggling and suffering, see
My destiny's to rest at ease, till I'm impressed and pleased
With my progress, I won't settle for less than cheese
I'm on a quest to seize all, my own label to call
Way before my baby is able to crawl
I'm too stable to fall, the pressure motivates
To know I hold the weight of boulders on my shoulder blades
I seen the golden gates to heaven on Earth
Where they don't pull a weapon on you when you stepping on turf, Q
Eye-Kyu:
Chorus: It's a broke day but everything is ok (It's ok)
I'm up all night, but everything is alright (It's alright)

It's a long year pretending I belong here (Belong here)
It's a broke day but everything is ok (It's ok)

Verse 2: Eminem
I'm going for broke, gambling and playing for keeps
Everyday in the streets, scrambling and paying for cheep
Praying for sleep
Dreaming with a watering mouth
Wishing for a better life for my daughter and spouse
In this slaughtering house, caught up in bouts
With the root of all evil
I've seen it turn beautiful people crude and deceitful
And make them do shit illegal
For these Grant's and Jackson's
These transactions explain a man's actions
But in the mist of this insanity, I found my Christianity
Through God and there's a wish he granted me
He showed me how to cope with the stress
And hope for the best, instead of mope and depressed
Always groping a mess, of flying over the nest
To selling dope with the rest
I quit smoking cess to open my chest
Life is stressful inside this cesspool
Trying to wrestle, I almost bust a blood vessel
My little brother's trying to learn his mathematics
He's asthmatic, running home from school away from crack addicts
Kids attract static, children with automatics
Taking target practice on teens for Starter Jackets
I'm using smarter tactics to overcome this slum
I won't become as dumb as some and succumb to scum
It's cumbersome, I'm trying to do well on this Earth
But it's been Hell on this Earth since I fell on this Earth

Chorus: It's a broke day but everything is ok (It's ok)
I'm up all night, but everything is alright (It's alright)
It's a rough week, and I don't get enough sleep (I can't sleep)

It's a broke day but everything is ok (It's ok)
I'm up all night, but everything is alright (It's alright)
It's a rough week, and I don't get enough sleep (I can't sleep)
It's a long year pretending I belong here (Belong here)
Uh, it's ok, yeah it's alright, even though I can't sleep
Uh yeah, it's ok, it's alright, I can't sleep"

So you wanna be a sweet MC, you gotta become me
If you ever wanna be one see
Eminem: Man what you know about a sweet MC, in the 313
None of these skills you bout to see come free
So you wanna be a sweet MC, you better become me
If you ever wanna be one see
Verse 1: Eye-Kyu
Yo some people say I'm whack, now if that's right
I'm the freshest whack MC that you ever heard, in your lifetime
My slick accapella sounds clever with the beats
Boy I'm the deepest thing since potholes to ever hit the streets
Forgot a gold digger's succubus, my souls thick with ruggedness
With the mic I'm like a dyke, can't no nigga fuck with this
I got more Different Strokes than Philip Drummound
On open mic I bone your women just to keep my lyrics coming (bitch)
We elevated to new heights premeditated
Let it be that I stated they hate it now that they see that I made it
The escalated can be put to the test of greatness
Snatch the heart from MC's and I ate it
So I take it that's the reason I'm hated
To represent my temperment
If rap was a dick all you so called hard MC's would not be impitant
But pimping it, and acting like you could rock a show (so)
Harder than LL's Rock the Bells, but you is a ho (now)
Everything that you collaborate I lacerate
My rhymes they keep coming like nympho maniacs that masturbate
At a faster rate, yeah I got something for your ass to hate
I blasterate, and have you all running master gates
And as for face clutching and touching the flows
I got them open like marijuana smoke up in your nose
Bucking these hoes, I got that shit down to a science
Leaving them hot and bothered, turned on like an appliance
Defiance, no we won't have that
You want your shit to blow up?
Well I'ma stuff some dynamite in your ass crack
And blast that shit to kingdom come
Then bring them some of this real hip-hop
I drop beats and you ain't singing or gonna do a thing about
And you all knew from Meeko
That you couldn't hold your own with the strength of Lou Forigno
So stop that bullshit and flow
Yo, you need to come with the real skills, and act like you know

So what, you know about a sweet MC, in the 313
You don't know shit so when you see one flee
You can be Run-D, you'll never beat the MC
I'll stop the alphabet at S and got it down to a T
I'm sure your bound to agree, a sweet MC crashes the spot
I'll make the roof hot like I was Rock Master Scott
Your ass forgot, so just in case you don't remember me
I'll run your brain around the block to jog your fucking memory
It's either them or me man, kill or be killed
You will and be sealed your casket closed you still gonna be billed
My facilities filled with fans, packed to capacity
I'll send a rapper back with the crack of his ass shitty
If he's acting soft and he cowers
He better come cleaner then Jay Rue jacking off when he showers
You flowers got no clout with a thing
You could date a stick of dynamite and wouldn't go out with a bang
I showered the slang, simple as A,B,C's
Skip over the D's and rock the microphone with E's
Dethrone MC's and I'ma max alone
Relax your dome like a solo from a saxophone
So facts are known, writers get treated with shocks
I rock a beat harder then you could beat it with rocks
I'm greeted with flocks, of fellow follower's singers
You couldn't make the fans throw up their hands if they swallowed their
fingers
But you can bring yours let's see what you got
But don't front and never try to be what you're not
Cause you can be quick, jump the candlestick, burn your back
And fuck Jill on a hill, but you still ain't Jack

Maxine!! (Phone Rings)
Maxine: Hello
Denaun: Can I speak to Maxine?
Maxine: Yeah this is me what's up?
Denaun: What up?
Maxine: Who dis?
Denaun: Denaun
Maxine: Yeah what's up?
Denaun: What are you doing?
Maxine: Nothing, just laying in bed
Denaun: Huh?
Maxine: Nothing, just laying in bed
Denaun: Why?
Maxine: I don't know, thinking about something freaky to do
Verse 1: Eminem
I know this crack fiend Maxine who needs a vaccine
She tests positive but tells you that her act's clean
Plus she got a sugar daddy
Asking every hooker that he takes in to crook her badly
If you mistook her sadly, on her reputation
You're in jepordation, if you ain't got no preparation
When you step away son, she got her face done
Looking provocative, she'll let you knock it if
You press the issue and get undressed to kiss you
If you match the price, otherwise she won't look at you twice
But when you catch the lice, or get the urgency
To go to the emergency cause it burns to pee
Don't bring your germs to me, cause I ain't trying to hear it
While your fighting you fucking disease trying to clear it (Maxine!!)
Verse 2: Denaun Porter
Sometimes I wonder, what's your purpose? In life that is
To get with every brother and unveil one of his kids, shit
You living trife, got three kids at home and club hopping every night
You say it's gonna stop but it.. just.. slows.. down
And then speeds back to a regular pace, there is no end to this
Mystery, whatever your reason even is to be
You say you wanna be with me, but how can you say that
When you got niggas hiding in your closet
I refrain from getting angry but you keep on that strangely
Verse 3: 3
I met this girl last week, she was a freak, and she liked me
So I stepped on it and then asked my homies
And chilled on the side and then watched they niggas
Big game over there and take notes, while I get this number
I stepped to her first I cleared my throat and said ""Hey Bitch..
Haven't I seen you before?"", looked at my nigga
Turned around and got slapped throughout my hands
And said ""Oh it's like that?""
She said she just broke up with her nigga and shit
She started crying, and asked me to forgive her and shit
She said her name was Maxine, so I told her I wanted her number
She asked could I give her mine two
Got to the crib and called her up
We got into a good conversation that's when she asked me could I fuck
I said ""Maxine check this out,
Give me your address I'll be through and you'll find out""
Got to the crib she let me in
She didn't waste time she grabbed my hand and proceeded to the bedroom
I said ""Hold up, and stop proceeding, you rushing things""
What the fuck are you doing?
So I went for my protection, took off my clothes and started flexing
As she went for my midsection
I threw her down as I tore off her shirt
Pulled out my jimmy and I thought about putting in work
Before I hit it she said
""3 don't get mad but there's something that I gotta tell your ass""
I said ""What is it, another nigga? It's ok""
She said ""No I forgot to tell you, that I got AIDS""
I got up out
Denaun: Hey, Maxine
Maxine: What
Denaun: You thinking about sucking my dick?
Maxine: Yeah for a small price
Denaun: For a small price? What you mean?
Maxine: You know, money nigga
Denaun: You don't need no damn money,
I can't give you no money anyways, I heard you got some shit.
Maxine: (laughing) What you, what you hear I got?
Denaun: AIDS
Maxine: (laughing) Who told you that bullshit?
Denaun: My nigga Kyu, he wouldn't lie
Maxine: Well if that's the case, Kyu got it then
Denaun: Oh for real, it's like that?
Maxine: (laughing) Well I ain't got shit,
so he ain't got shit, and if he do, he ain't get that shit from me,
I ain't fucking around with no 3rd nigga
Denaun: Fuck that, I ain't fucking with you
Maxine: No, see..
Denaun: You got that shit, I ain't gotta fuck with you
Maxine: Hold on, why it ain't even like that
Denaun: I want ya'll to get paid, fucking..
Maxine: (laughing as the phone hangs up)"

That's cause you whack!

You always rap first,

Thyme:
Ayo, who the fuck passed you the mic and said that you can flow?
Point him out man I wanna know
Who the fuck passed you the mic and said that you can flow?
(scratched in) I wanna know, I wanna know
I said who the fuck passed you the mic and said that you can flow?
Point him out bitch I wanna know
Who the fuck passed you the mic and said that you can flow?
(scratched in) I wanna know, I wanna know
Verse 1: Eminem
I'll have you taken back to Christ when you sacrifice
The way you acting slice when I tear your back with knifes
Jacking life's of MC's, now I'm set to launch a plan
For blowing up the stage with illegal contraband
A stomped your man so unless you want what he got
You better set the mic down, I'm steaming like a teapot
I'll make the tea hot, people get in my face and ask
If I wanna battle, then I chase them in a Jason mask
It's an amazing task to battle with success
I never gave a fuck, now I give a fuck less
And in a slug fest I get physical like physicians
Invisible like magicians with mystical mic traditions
Wicked wizardry, like a sorcerer and no remorse for you
When I torture you throughout the course of my orchestra
So feel the force of my spiritual images
Slicing up an enemy's appendages till he hemorrhages
My skin itches every time a rapper recites
And when he's through with his verse, I'm all covered in flea bites
You wanna see fights I got a match for you
You couldn't flip shit playing in toilets with a spatula
Chorus: Thyme
Ayo, who the fuck passed you the mic and said that you can flow?
Point him out man I wanna know
Who the fuck passed you the mic and said that you can flow?
(scratched in) I wanna know, I wanna know
Ayo, who the fuck passed you the mic and said that you can flow?
Point him out bitch I wanna know
Who the fuck passed you the mic and said that you can flow?
(scratched in) I wanna know, I wanna know
Verse 2: Eminem
You bitches get a hysterectomy disrespecting me
You wanna feel the full effect of me, hand a tech to me
Intellectually superior, I'll make the whack wearier
Inferior, deterior rate, like bacteria
Materially, killing serially, clearly you'll see
How much in fear when u hear me you'll be
Shiver and shake, quiver and quake
Bite a rhyme and rip it off then stiffer and ache, whither and break
You slithering snake, gibbering fake, fibbering flake
I'll twist you into a different shape
And toss you in Michigan Lake, for fisherman sake
If this is a dream you'd wish you can wake
Every dis you can take, personal
We ain't friends trying to make amends
If you ain't ever stole a gate you can take a fence
I make intense masterpieces and smash to pieces
Your last releases, you bad diseases, that's the reason
I'm showing you the proper way to operate a mic
So pass it like a hot potato
I've never been less than clever and fresh
Severing flesh of fools who never impressed I can confess
Chorus: Thyme
Who the fuck passed you the mic and said that you can flow?
Point him out man I wanna know
Who the fuck passed you the mic and said that you can flow?
(scratched in) I wanna know, I wanna know
Ayo, who the fuck passed you the mic man and said that you can flow?
Point him out bitch I wanna know
Who the fuck passed you the mic and then said that you can flow?
(scratched in) I wanna know, I wanna know
Whhhooo the fuck passed you the mic and said that you can flow?
Point him out!! I wanna know
Who the fuck passed you the mic and said that you can flow?

Ya heard?
Chillen, cold as hell
Yes it is, hey Busta didn't come here did he?
No, hey look, you got fifteen cent?
Nah, I got just enough to get on the bus, I'm broke
We gotta go to the store alright man quick cause I'm short
Yeah, we gonna have enough time to go to the store?
Nah, look..
You should just, how much you got there?
I only got 75, I'm sure I got a dollar know what I mean..
Just throw it in there they ain't gonna know
You know what look, I'm sick of taking this damn bus everywhere man
You gotta make some moves or something
I know look, I'm trying to get rich,
I got a baby on the way, I don't even got a car,
you know what I'm saying?
I still stay with my moms, 21 and still with my moms
Look hey, we gotta make some hit records or something,
you know what I'm saying? Cause I'm tired of being broke
Verse 1:
Cause all I do is yearn a life without a concern
And dream of having a turn to earn money to burn
Mapping out my strategies to get rich huh
My desire is like a scratch that needs to get itched huh
Cause man I live in the D, this shit ain't given for free
Nothing's different to me, so what, it's easy to see
I'll be the prisoner to flee, all of this misery
I'm not wishing to be another fish in the sea
But just an MC, so listen to me, but if you disagree
You missing the key, you ain't even in the brisk of the tea
Unconditionally my aspects to cash checks
My objects were never to swab decks
It's up to you the decision is yours
If what you vision is tours, or a mission less course
When shit is in the stores, cause you can be a star
Chorus:
No matter wherever you are, you're never too far
From revenue huh, cause you can be king
You can rule the world, you can do anything
It's on you baby, cause you can be a star

From revenue huh, cause you can be king
You can rule the world, you can do anything

No matter wherever you are, you're never too far
From revenue huh
You know what I'm saying, see what I'm talking about man?
Cause that's it
Yeah
A million dollars ain't even that far away man
Yo we got to get the money man, I can't be broke for the rest of my life
Yeah I hear what your saying,
look there's got to be something better, you know what I'm saying?
I can't live like this for the rest of my life man,
bumming rides everywhere I go
Yeah, what's up with Lexus' and Land cruisers'?
Verse 2:
Yo I'm not about to chance it and dismiss handling business
I'm canceling Christmas to gamble and risk this
Financial interest is the matter at hand
I got an adequate plan for stab at a grand
I grab what I can and do what I must
Pursue what I lust, it's true that I just choose
The few that I trust, thems the people that I still got
Fuck with gangsta fill pot, get your grill shot
The 5 Elemantz for life my man Thyme
Proof, Kyu and Denaun, we move through into time
My crews true and divine, we never fronted
We just wanted to be funded, and live to be a hundred
Instead of hunted or being wanted as fugitives
It's all about a man planning what his future is
What he can do for his to be a star

No matter wherever you are, you're never too far
From revenue huh, cause you can be king
You can rule the world, you can do anything

You can rule the world, you can do anything
It's on you baby, cause you can be a star
No matter wherever you are, you're never too far
From revenue huh
That's what I'm talking about, I'm not trying to be the player,
I'm trying to be the man, I'm want to be President
Yo forgot that President man I'm trying to be king,

You only live once

Searchin',Infinite,1996,"Women Singing: Ain't no one special, special like you (4X)
I been searching, but your the one I want in my life baby (4X)
Verse 1: Eminem
I'm reminiscing on your tenderness and the snuggling and teasing
Missing what I remember, kissing and hugging and squeezing
Bugging and weezing, I'm having trouble when breathing
It's even tougher when sleeping
But there's a couple of reasons that I'm suffering and grieving
For loving and leaving, you all I'm thinking of in the evening
You got my knees buckling and weakening
Thoughts of nothing but freaking that I'm struggling to keep in
And interrupt when I'm speaking
I got some game that I'm preparing to run The way your lips sparkle and glare in the sun
You got your hair in a bun, no matter what you're wearing you stun
Cause your comparing to none, I wanna share in the fun
I feel a passionate lust when I'm imagining just us alone at last with a touch I see you grasping to trust, but my intentions are good
The seed is passing in dust
I'm not asking to rush and answer immediately
I just wanna be there for you and you to be there for me
If you agree to repeat after me, I Love You (I love you baby)
Cause I just need you to see, how much I'm eager to beYour man legally wed, your love's keeping me fed
This is easily said, so you can lead or be led
If you care to be down cause ain't nobody Like you no where to be found
Chorus:Women Singing:
I been searching, but your the one I want in my life baby (4X)
Verse 2: Denaun Porter
Baby it's all on you, it's you I call on boo
Let's set a day up so you can fall on through
We'll take a spin in a Lexus you can chill for dinner and breakfast
Long enough to see how this gentleman sex'es
We'll start it out with caviar, Don Parigne
And then when it's a fact we are warm, carry on We'll take it slow, see nobody will hurry things
I got the herbs the Bacardi and Hurricane
If Daiquiris are in debate and not your thing that dayIt's still all right cause
I got Minute Maid and Tangeray
Your an incredible one that's rare, in bed with edible underwear
You look impeccable, nothing compares
I dream of freaking you, the women that will speak it too so
It seems that there is not an end to things that we can do so
Now we all set to play, only thing left to say is
When you step away, baby but don't forget the Neglicie
Chorus:Women Singing:
I been searching, but your the one I want in my life baby (8X)
Ain't no one special, special like you (2X)"
Backstabber,Infinite,1996,"Police voice:
Attention all units, attention all units
We have an All Points Bulletin out on a man with green hair
I repeat, we have an APB on a man with green hair
He's armed with a knife, I repeat, he's armed with a knife
Proceed with caution, watch your back fella's
He could be coming at your girlfriend next
Verse 1:
There's a joker on the loose from the psychiatric ward
His face is up on the bulletin board with a reward
He'll stab you with a sword don't be fooled by his charm
He's probably armed with intent to do bodily harm
Ring the alarm, look for a man with green hair
Check at your girl's house, he was last seen there
He's has a mean stare but usually crack's jokes
Good luck on your mission and guard your backs folks
Chorus:
I make you think you're a best friend then
Why I oughtta
Hit a bitch snake from the back, I make you think you're a best friend then
Why I oughtta
Stay away from him he ain't no good!
Verse 2:
We got the walkie-talkies to keep us all informed
Suited up head to toe in detective uniforms
Our unit storms in, we split the ghetto in sectors
Locking down every block and put up metal detectors
Protectors and be sure that you stand close
Watch each others backs and guard your command post
And most of all be advised that he's wise
He could be disguised as one of your very own guys
Chorus:
I make you think you're a best friend then
Why I oughtta
Hit a bitch snake from the back, I make you think you're a best friend then
Why I oughtta
Stay away from him he ain't no good!
Verse 3:
I'm on a solo mission to find him personally
To settle the score and beat then him mercifully
For what he first did to me
It's sure to be the last
Following footprints with a magnifying glass
To drag his lying ass back to his padded cell
I'm mad as hell, on the trail of the tattle tail
I heard a yell the voice sounded familiar
""Give me your girlfriend or I'm gonna kill ya""
Chorus:
I make you think you're a best friend then
Why I oughtta
Hit a bitch snake from the back, I make you think you're a best friend then
Why I oughtta
Stay away from him he ain't no good!
Verse 4:
I followed the voice that led down a flight of steps
Sneezing at dust, and swinging at the spider-webs
Inside the depths of his basement
I taste lint in my mouth, then the lights in the place… went!
I saw my life flash in front of my eyes
I felt a butcher knife slash at one of my thighs
None of my guys knew where I'm at I was doomed
Then I remembered the flashlight in my costume
Chorus:
I make you think you're a best friend then
Why I oughtta
Hit a bitch snake from the back, I make you think you're a best friend then
Why I oughtta
Stay away from him he ain't no good!
Verse 5:
Dealing with backstabber's there was one thing I learned
They're only powerful when you got your back turned
I yearned for the day that we finally met again
So I can give him a taste of his own medicine
He shed his skin, then he promised to come clean
I took his butcher knife and jabbed it into his spleen
Cut him at the seam then dragged the fella home
Beating him over the head with the telephone
Police voice:
Attention all cars, attention all cars
Unit 313 has apprehended the suspect
He's going back to the crazy home, I repeat
He's going back to the crazy home, how about that?
Chorus:
I make you think you're a best friend then
Why I oughtta
Hit a bitch snake from the back, I make you think you're a best friend then
Why I oughtta
Stay away from him he ain't no good!
I make you think you're a best friend then
Why I oughtta
Hit a bitch snake from the back, I make you think you're a best friend then
Why I oughtta
Stay away from him he ain't no good!
I make you think you're a best friend then
Why I oughtta
Hit a bitch snake from the back, I make you think you're a best friend then
Why I oughtta
Stay away from him he ain't no good!"

Jealous! (8X)
Girls voice: (Talking over the singing)
Jealous!?! What he mean jealous, know what I'm saying?
He just mad cause he got with some ugly hoes, know what I'm saying?
Girls don't buy him no clothes, He bought that ho some clothes!!
He don't buy me no clothes, Nigga ain't got no money, no vibe, no dick
I mean, What do I got to be jealous for?
He ain't gonna make it no where, he ain't got no type of time
He has no career move, I mean...
Verse 1:
I come home every single day from working double shifts
And stop along the way to pick you up a couple gifts
I come inside and you pretend you miss me when you kiss me
Then you diss me and we strenuously fight continuously
Again you frisk me, for numbers trying to bust me
It must be only just because you never learned to trust me
Plus we only grovel only irrelevant issues
To many tissues, for my feelings you misuse
I buy you jewelry, you make a fool of me
I bring you diamond rings you say I'm bad at timing things
So what's a man to do when all i hand to you is handed back to me
You act to be this gangsta bitch, that ain't what first attracted me
I used to love your company now you always bugging me
For information and you tell your friends you plan on dumping me
So I'ma wait for your evacuation
Cause every accusation makes me wanna smack your face in
See I've never been so sure, and your just insecure
So my solution to your jealousy presents a cure
I recommend you take your things and check them in
Look at the nervous wreck I'm in, I need my second wind, Say What?

Women's Voice: (Talking over singing)
Fuck you and what you going through
Fuck Eminem, he just mad cause I left that nigga for another man
Me and Eminem don't need nothing but my and his money
Immature, Me? Nigga ain't got no dick, no swang in his thang
Know what I'm saying? He just mad cause I'm getting it all night
Jealous of me, know what I'm saying? That's what I'm talking about
Mother fucker just trying to get his pussy
Verse 2:
I used to be a puppet and a sucker for your silent treatments
I used to be intoxicated with your sweet sense
Until the day I started following your feetprints
And tapping in your phone conversations through the heat vents
It made complete sense, there's someone else you like
So I confronted you and asked you who was Mike?
And you was like, (sampled) **I need a new nigga**
Someone rich that I could follow
And you'll be over me by the time you see tomorrow
Leaving me in sorrow, Brandy never felt so broken hearted
I fell apart when you departed then the joking started
I was an open target, you play comedian
And I became the laughing stock. but now I'm on my feet again
And so we meet again, your acting like an ex-wife
All in my sex life, I got a message from Phife
He goes, ""You didn't want me to see you then, I don't want you now""
Take a towel, wipe your brow, quit trying to hunt me down
You run me down and now your trying to apologize
For all the lies and everytime you made me ball my eyes
Because I got a bigger wallet size, you wanna swing it
Jealousy is in the house ya'll, Fellas sing it...
