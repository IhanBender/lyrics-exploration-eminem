Pretend he never existed?\nMaybe gone, but he's not forgotten\nAnd don't think cause he's been out the pictures so long\nThat I've stopped the plottin' and still ain't comin' to git 'cha\nYou're wrong and that shit was rotten\nAnd the way you played him's same shit you did to me, cold\nHave you any idea the shit I've gone through?\nFeelings I harbor, all this pent-up resentment I hold on to\nNot once you call to ask me how I'm doing\nLetters you don't respond to 'em\nFuck it, I'm coming to see you\nAnd gee who better to talk to than you?\nThe cause of my problems\nMy life is garbage and I'm 'bout to take it out on you\nPuff, then I'm gone\nI flee the scene like it was my last ride\nYou see right through, oh, you had me pegged the first time\nYou can see the truth but it's easier to justify what's bad is good\nAnd I hate to be the bad guy, I just hate to be the bad guy\nI've been driving around your side of this town\nLike 9 frickin' hours and 45 minutes now\nFinally I found your new address, park in your drive\nFeel like I've been waiting on this moment all of my life\nAnd it's now arrived, and my mouth is full of saliva\nMy knife is out and I'm ducking on the side of your house\nSee, it's sad it came to this point\nSuch a disappointment I had to make this appointment to come and see ya\nBut ain't here for ya empathy, I don't need your apology\nOr your friendship of sympathy, it's revenge that I seek\nSo I sneak vengefully and treat your bedroom window\nLike I reach my full potential, I peeked\nContinue to peep, still bent low\nThen keep tapping the glass lightly then start to crescendo\nSneak all the way 'round to the back porch\nMan, door handles unlocked, shouldn't be that easy to do this\nYou don't plan for intruders beforehand?\nSurprised to see me? Cat got your tongue?\nGag, chloroform rag, dag almost hack up a lung\nLike you picked an axe up and then swung\nStick to the core plan, dragged to the back of a trunk\nBy one of your fans, irony spectacular, huh?\nNow who's a faggot, you punk?\nAnd here's your bronco hat, you can have that shit back cause they suck\nIt's just me, you and the music now, Slim\nI hope you hear it, we're in a car right now\nWait, here comes my favorite lyric\n\"I'm the bad guy who makes fun of people that die\"\nAnd hey, here's a sequel to my Mathers Lp\nJust to try to get people to buy\nHow's this for publicity stunt? This should be fun\nLast album now cause after this you'll be officially done\nEminem killed by m and m\nMatthew Mitchell, bitch, I even have your initials\nI initially was gonna bury you next to my brother, but fuck it\nSince you're in love with your city so much\nI figured, what the fuck, the best place you could be buried alive is right here\nTwo more exits, time is quite near\nHope we don't get stopped, no license I fear\nThat sirens I hear?

everyday\nLooking boy\nHey, looking boy, what you say looking boy?\nI got a \"hell yeah\" from Dre looking boy\nI'mma work for everything I have\nNever ask nobody for shit\nGet outta my face looking boy\nBasically boy you're never gonna be capable\nTo keep up with the same pace looking boy\nI'm beginning to feel like a Rap God, Rap God\nAll my people from the front to the back nod, back nod\nThe way I'm racing around the track\nCall me Nascar, Nascar\nDale Earnhardt of the trailer park\nThe White Trash God\nKneel before General Zod this planet's Krypton\nNo Asgard, Asgard\nSo you be Thor and I'll be Odin\nYou rodent, I'm omnipotent\nLet off then I'm reloading immediately\nWith these bombs I'm totin'\nAnd I should not be woken\nI'm the walking dead, but I'm just a talking head\nA zombie floating\nBut I got your mom deep throating\nI'm out my ramen noodle\nWe have nothing in common, poodle\nI'm a doberman, pinch yourself in the arm\nAnd pay homage, pupil\nIt's me, my honesty's brutal\nBut it's honestly futile if I don't utilize what I do though\nFor good at least once in a while\nSo I wanna make sure somewhere\nIn this chicken scratch I scribble and doodle\nEnough rhymes to maybe to try\nAnd help get some people through tough times\nBut I gotta keep a few punchlines just in case\n'Cause even you unsigned\nRappers are hungry looking at me\nLike it's lunchtime\nI know there was a time where once I\nWas king of the underground\nBut I still rap like I'm on my Pharoahe Monch grind\nSo I crunch rhymes, but sometimes when you combine\nAppeal with the skin color of mine\nYou get too big\nAnd here they come trying to censor you\nLike that one line I said on \"I'm Back\"\nFrom the Marshall Mathers Lp\nOne where I tried to say I take seven kids from Columbine\nPut 'em all in a line, add an Ak-47, a revolver and a nine\nSee if I get away with it now\nThat I ain't as big as I was\nBut I've Morphed into an immortal coming through the portal\nYou're stuck in a timewarp from 2004 though\nAnd I don't know what the fuck that you rhyme for\nYou're pointless as Rapunzel with fucking cornrows\nYou're like normal, fuck being normal\nAnd I just bought a new Raygun from the future\nTo just come and shoot ya like\nWhen Fabolous made Ray J mad\nCause Fab said he looked like a fag\nAt Maywhether's pad\nSingin' to a man while they played piano\nMan, oh man, that was a 24 7 special\nOn the cable channel\nSo Ray J went straight to the radio station the very next day\n''Hey, Fab, I'mma kill you''\nLyrics coming at you at supersonic speed\n(Jj Fad)\nUh, sama lamaa duma lamaa\nYou assuming I'm a human\nWhat I gotta do to get it through to you\nI'm superhuman\nInnovative and I'm made of rubber\nSo that anything you saying\nRicocheting off of me\nAnd it'll glue to you\nI'm never stating\nMore than never demonstrating\nHow to give a motherfuckin' audience\nA feeling like it's levitating\nNever fading\nAnd I know that the haters are forever waiting\nFor the day that they can say I fell off\nThey'd be celebrating\n'Cause I know the way to get 'em motivated\nI make elevating music, you make elevator music\nOh, he's too mainstream\nWell, that's what they do\nWhen they get jealous, they confuse it\nIt's not hip hop, it's pop, cause I found a hella way to fuse it\nWith rock, shock rap with Doc\nThrow on Lose Yourself and make 'em lose it\nI don't know how to make songs like that\nI don't know what words to use\nLet me know when it occurs to you\nWhile I'm ripping any one of these verses\nDiverse as you\nIt's curtains, I'm inadvertently hurtin' you\nHow many verses I gotta murder to prove\nThat if you're half as nice at songs\nYou can sacrifice virgins too\nSchool flunkie, pill junky\nBut look at the accolades the skills brung me\nFull of myself, but still hungry\nI bully myself cause I make me do\nWhat I put my mind to\nAnd I'm a million leagues above you\nIll when I speak in tongues\nBut it's still tongue in cheek, fuck you\nI'm drunk so Satan take the fucking wheel\nI'm asleep in the front seat\nBumping Heavy D and the Boys, still \"Chunky, But Funky\"\nBut in my head there's something\nI can feel tugging and struggling\nAngels fight with devils\nHere's what they want from me\nThey asking me to eliminate\nSome of the women hate\nBut if you take into consideration\nThe bitter hatred that I had\nThen you may be a little patient\nAnd more symphatetic to the situation\nAnd understand the discrimation\nBut fuck it, life's handing you lemons, make lemonade then\nBut if I can't batter the women how the fuck\nAm I supposed to bake them a cake then?\nDon't mistake it for Satan\nIt's a fatal mistake if you think I need to be overseas\nAnd take a vacation to trip a broad\nAnd make her fall on her face and don't be a retard\nBe a king? Think not\nWhy be a king when you can be a God?"},

it rain all spring\nY'all seen my story my glory\nI had raped the game young\nYou can call it statutory\nWhen a nigga blow up\nThey can build statures of me\nOld money Benjamin Button, whaat, nuttin\nNow superbad chicks giving me macLovin\nYou would think I ran the world\nLike Michelle's husband\nYou would think these niggas would know me\nWhen they really doesn't\nLike they was down with the old me\nNo you fucking wasn't\nYou're such a fucking loser\nHe didn't even go to class bueller\nTrade the Grammy plaques just to have\nMy granny back\nRemember she had that bad hip\nLike a fanny pack\nChasing that stardom would turn you into a maniac\nAll the way in Hollywood and I can't even act\nThey pull their cameras out\nAnd God damn they snap\nI used to want this thing forever\nY'all

Jordams\nI want this shit forever wake up\nAnd smell the Garden\nFresh then the hardest\nStep up to the target\nIf I had one guess than I guess I'm just New Orleans\nAnd I will never stop like I'm running from the cops\nHop up in my car and told my chauffeur to the top\nLife is such a fucking roller coaster then it drops\nBut what should I scream for this is my theme park\nMy minds shine even\nWhen my thoughts seem dark\nPistol on my side you don't wanna hear that thing talk\nLet the king talk check the price and pay attention\nLittle Wayne that's what they got to say or mention\nI'm like Nevada in the middle of the summer\nI'm resting in the lead I need\nA pillow and a cover\nSchhhhhhh, my foot is sleeping on the gas\nNo brake pads no such thing as last\n(Drake)\nIt may not mean

contain me\nAnd they go so balistic whoa\nHe can make them look like bozos\nHe's wonderin if he should spit this slow\nFuck no, go for broke, his cup\nJust runneth over oh no\nHe aint had a buzz like this\nSince the last time he overdosed\nThey have been waiting patiently\nFor pinnochio to poke his nose\nBack into the game and they know\nRap will never be the same as before\nBashin' into the brains of these hoes\nAnd Establishin' a name as he goes\nThe passion and the flame is ignited\nYou can't put it out once we light it\nThis shit is exactly what the fuck\nThat I'm talking bout when we riot\nYou dealin' with a few true villians whose staying\ninside of the booth truth spillin'\nAnd spit true feelings until our tooth fillings\nCome flying up out of our mouths now rewind it\nPayback muthafucka for the way that you got at me\nHow's it taste? When I slap the taste\nOut of your mouth with the bass so loud\nThat it shakes the place\nI'm hannibal lecter so just in case\nYou was thinkin of savin face\nYou aint gonna have no face to save by the time\nI'm through with this place so drake\n(Drake)\nIt may not mean nothing to y'all\nBut understand nothing was done for me\nSo I don't plan on stopping at all\nI want this shit forever man\nEver man, ever man\nI'm shutting shit down at the mall\nAnd telling every girl she the one for me\nAnd I ain't even planning to call\nI want this shit forever man, ever man, ever man"},
